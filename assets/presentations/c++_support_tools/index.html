          <h3>Previous Education Agenda</h3>
          <hr/>
          <ul>
            <li>An Overview of Build and DevOps</li>
            <li>A Dive Into the Build Process</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class = "notes">
          On our previous education sessions, I presented an overview of Build 
          such as why a dedicated build team exist, different types of builds 
          such as nightly and CI builds, and an overview of DevOps briefly 
          covering CI/CD pipelines.

          The next session was more technical where I dived into the Build Process 
          going over each step in GCC's compilation pipeline. 
          I also covered briefly about static and dynamic libraries 
          since I thought that would also be useful.

          So I debated what I should take a look next. While I had many random 
          ideas such as covering the fundamentals of Db2 or cover something 
          specific to the team such as how BldInfo and Bldstat works.

          So naturally we should cover tools developers could use after a Build

          <aside class = "notes">
            I concluded that it would be best to build from my previous education sessions 
            which are Developer Support Tools C/C++ developers utilize in their 
            development cycle. Although we are not developers, we are part of 
            Db2 ecosystem which attempts to improve productivity and workflow 
            of developers so I think it's a good idea to explore briefly of 
            the various tools that exist. As a disclaimer, I am not a developer 
            as you all know and most of what I am presenting is actually new to 
            me. Therefore this talk will not be technical but going over a general overview of 
            various topics and tools. In addition, these slides were made quickly as I realized I didn't 
            have much time with the team to do through research.

          <h3>Documentation Tools</h3>
          Doxygen (A tool similar to Javadoc)
          <aside class = "notes">
            Let's begin with the tools we used to use at IBM Db2 which some of you may 
            be aware of. Documentation can be a pain to write and when we have 
            a code base that spans over 1000s of files and million lines of code, 
            it gets hard to understand the codebase. That's where Doxygen 
            come into the scene

          <h3>Why Use A Documentation Generator</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Easy to maintain & Never Forget</b><small>No need to have a dedicated storage nor project for documentation</small></li>
            <li><b>Living Document</b> <small>Anytime an API changes or a new function is created, the documentation will reflect the code changes</small></li>
            <li><b>Variety of Formats</b><small>Can generate web documents (HTML), PDF, man pages and many more</small></li>
          </ul>
          <small><b>Disclaimer:</b> Stole the points from internal wiki</small>
        <aside class = "notes">
          Doxygen is similar to Javadocs where it automatically generates 
          documentation in variety of formats such as HTML and PDF using 
          the information from the comments in the source code.

          The benefits of using a documentation generator is that you never need to maintain a repository of documentation 
          that you may forget about. For instance, I recently found a forgotten internal documentation webserver that our team owns 
          where early documents from Db2 v7 lies in. It's also easy to maintain because it is generated directly from the source code.

          It allows for "living" documentation where any changes to the code will be reflected in the generated documentation. You can also embed design information 
          as well. 

          We probably don't maintain a server containing documents generated from doxygen anymore (probably deleted due to space issues on the server) but if you ever want to, you could probably generate it quickly yourself.

            </ol>
            <aside class = "notes">
              There are two types of code analysis: static and dynamic. The difference between the two is the fact that static analysis does not 
              require the program to be executed while dynamic performs analysis during program execution. Code analysis are great tools to catch common 
              bugs, security loopholes, data leaks, and enforce good coding standards.

            <h2>Static Analysis</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>examines source code and compares it with a set of coding rules for potential errors</li>
              <li>Does not require program to be executed</li>
            </ul>

            <aside class = "notes">
              Most static code analyzers look at the source code but some can look at the binaries. Static analyzers examines the source code and compares it 
              with a set of rules, policies or a dataset generated either by your organization or from the developers of the tools.  Though it also employs 
              different algorithms and techniques to identify bugs that your compiler may not catch such as
              common flaws and vulnerabilities in your code making your product much more secure. Typically, static analysis is embedded in CI workflow to ensure 
              product security and ensure organizations coding standards and compliances are met.

              When we talk about static analyzers in our team, we typically are referring to SAST, static analyzers that 
              focus on making software applications secure. Here are some examples of SAST Tools available on the market. Github has 
              introduced a few years back Github Actions which gives developers basic native CI/CD solutions. One of the perks is that 
              they don't require you to have your own CI/CD server such as Jenkins nor have agents (called runners on github) because 
              Github can run your CI/CD workflow on their own servers on Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu. It's quite easy to integrate SAST 
              into your github workflow by using the various templates offered on the marketplace and many are free. Here are some 
              examples of some SAST workflows that Github suggests.

              SAST isn't the only usage for static analyzers. There are many other tools available that focus on guideline enforcement 
              and avoid any potential bugs that your compiler fails to catch. 
              For instance, this is the result from the 2021 Jetbrain ecosystem survey and you don't see any of the SAST tools I 
              mentioned earlier.

              Let's go over some of the ones listed. The Clang project which focuses on compiler front-end for C/C++ have released a number of 
              neat tools such as Clang-tidy, ClangFormat, and Clang Static Analyzers.

            <aside class = "notes">
              Clang tidy is a linter which can also diagnose and fix typical programming errors, style violations, and interface misuse.
              It's highly customizable apparently so you can run custom scripts to enforce stricter guidelines and propose customized fixes. I heard it's a great tool 
              to refactor code such as adding `override` specifier on all methods in a legacy codebase that's not using C++ 11 or newer. You can either get a poor intern 
              to go through thousands of files to change those instances or use a single tool to do the job.

              ClangFormat as the name implies reformats your code to follow a particular codestyle such as LLVM, Google, or tailor it to follow your company's coding guideline. 
              It's a neat tool to ensure everyone uses the same style with no arguments on code style.
