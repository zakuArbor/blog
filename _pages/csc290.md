## WHAT IS CSC290?
CSC290 (Communication Skills for Computer Science) is a course that is offered at the University of Toronto. The course is mandatory for all students pursuing a major or specialist in Computer Science. The aim for the course is to enhance the written, verbal, team work and critical thinking of students who aim to pursue a profession in the Tech Sector.

In the course, students are instructed to write a blog on an assigned topic each week to practice their writing and thinking. Below are various blogs I have written in the course:
* [Communications in IT](communications-in-it)
