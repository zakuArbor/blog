The name is Ju Hong Kim, a student, software developer, and a random human who writes random things. I am a computer enthusiast and I love learning new things and expanding my knowledge. 
With no plans in mind, I'll be venturing into Math and Physics at some random Canadian University till I get bored of it.

My background is in Computer Science and I am particularly interested in reading and learning about Systems Programming (though I am quite lacking in experience and knowledge). 
More specifically, I want to delve into Operating Systems and Embedded Programming since it looks like it'll be interesting. I initially got into computers after being introduced to 
HTML during middle school by a friend who told me that websites could be created through notepad. Since then, I fiddled with various languages throughout Highschool and ended up studying 
Computer Science at a Canadian University before studying Math and Physics at another random Canadian University.

## Purpose

There's no purpose of this blog other than to kill time and write random things that I find interesting or bothering me. 

* [Personal](../personal) section is where I ramble whatever I felt like writing at the moment such as my education experience
* [Programming](../programming) section is where I ramble various topics in Computer Science and Programming that I find to be interesting. 
It's a great medium to reiterate what I learned.
* [Physics & Math](../math-physics) is a brand new section where I plan to write about various things in Math and Physics as I undergo my studies in Math & Physics hopefully. 
It's a place where I can reinforce my knowledge. Do bear with me as the first dozen of posts will probably be very obvious and simple. My knowledge of the subject is very small (hence why I am going  
back to school in hopes I can be scientific literate).
