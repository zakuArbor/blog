**Hello World**

My name is Ju Hong Kim, a random human who writes random things. I am a computer enthusiast and I love learning new things and expanding my knowledge.

My background is in Computer Science and I am particularly interested in reading and learning about Systems Programming (though I am quite lacking in experience and knowledge). My current goals are to self-study more about Operating Systems, embedded systems, and system programming including learning more about C++.
