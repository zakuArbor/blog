[In my previous blog post discussing about double angles and its relation with matrix rotations](../double-angle-rot), I explored 
[Manim Python Library](https://www.manim.community/) to animate math. Instead of catching up in a course I am supposed to be 
self studying (I assured the prof I would by the end of summer but not going so well), I've been fiddling with a few projects 
over the past 2 weeks. Below is a preview of one of the projects I have been working on (there's no sound and is simply a preview, I 
still need to edit the script, adjust the timing of each frame, and record the voice):

**Edit (07/02/2022):** Reuploaded video to fix an error in presenting the result of the matrix multplication
