Today's post is a filler post in case I cannot think of anything to write for the month. It's a babble of my thoughts on a circle, a very simple 
geometry shape.

* circle relation with trig (i.e. triangles)
* radians
* equi-distant meaning a radius spinning a full circle draws a circle (i.e. think of a record player pin)
* $C = 2\pi R$ is the distance
* If rearranged: $\frac{C}{2R} = \pi$ shows that pi is just a ratio between circumference and diameter (a way to remember the meaning of pi)
* $A = \pi r^2 \rightarrow dA = 2\pi r$ interesting how derivatives can give you circumference but doesn't work with integration unless we do indefinite integration
* $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ I wonder how this was derived
* symmetrical no matter where you split it and even no matter how many slices you make
* radians
* sector, segment, secant, and etc
* deriving area by squares (we know less than area of square) than triangles
* how to draw circles using equations $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$
* circles are similar - define similar
