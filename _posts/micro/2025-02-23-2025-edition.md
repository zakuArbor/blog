description: 2024 Edition of All MicroPosts on RandomBit's Neocities webpage

---

In 2023, I was fascinated in learning about a revival of the old internet where chaos and nostalgia ensues in neocities which is an attempt to recreate the community of the old internet 
that geocities provided in the past. However, I never progressed much aside from creating an initial introduction page. Almost a year after in the summer of August 2024, I decided to 
take advantage of the amount of free time I have rececntly due to taking a break from school 
to start posting shorter content as a way to write something quick and potentially more personal as this blog site has become 
more of a technical blog rather than a personal blog. Though that doesn't mean I won't post random odd blog posts that aren't technical nor do I guarantee any professional (it is 
the internet and a blog site that I maintain without any sponsorship nor earn anything monetary). Though any potential chaos or out of context content I may post in the future will be 
contained in my neocities site while it lasts which should spare this blog site from any weird oddities for the time being.

While my microblog isn't exactly short, it is definitely shorter than my typical technical blog posts. You will probably see some parallels between my microblog and the blogs I post 
here. This is because some of the technical aspects of the micro posts are the quick scratch notes that gives an overview of the topic I wish to write about on this blog site.

<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rkTgPt3M4k">Linus Tech Tips (LTT)</a> introduced Framework, a repairable and modular laptop, back in 2021, I always wanted one for myself. I always loved the idea of modular electronics 
ever since <a href="https://www.onearmy.earth/project/phonebloks">PhoneBloks</a> introduced their idea of modular phones. Electronics that are modular are usually highly repairable due to the fact that one can easily swap a faulty 
component with a new component instead of going to a repair shop or dumping the phone into the garbage. The appeal of bringing the desktop experience of being able to upgrade various parts such as the CPU, RAM and storage to the laptop 
was very appealing. Electronics of the past were much easier to repair and upgrade but these days laptops are designed to not be easily upgradable such as the use of soldered RAM. 
Laptops are also designed to not be as repairable as it once was with the use of integrating more components into the SoC which allows manufacturers to significantly design a more 
compact and sleeker device. There are lots of benefits of SoC than just compactness, it also can help with power efficiency and speed as it can be optimized to have fast access to both the 
CPU and memory. While there could be engineering reasons to soldered RAM, it is likely to also encourage consumers to purchase a new laptop instead.</p>

<p class="caption">A Framework laptop and its various parts. Source: <a href="https://frame.work/ca/en">Framework</a></p>

<p>The Framework laptop is great but every criticism you have heard about the Framework laptop holds true. Cost is the biggest issue with Framework laptops. As Framework is a small company, it cannot build in scale unlike the other OEMs. You will be paying an extremely hefty price to obtain a modular laptop. You could get a laptop 
from other OEMs with better specs for way less than what Framework offers. The laptop is not suitable for the regular consumers and is way more expensive than a luxurious laptop (aka Macbooks). There are other issues with the Framework 
laptop but I consider this to not be the cost of Framework but rather the cost of modularity. As I mentioned earlier, there are tradeoffs between modularity and integrating everything into 
an SoC. When you are getting a Framework laptop, you are buying the laptop for its modularity and repairability. For instance, when you buy a Framework 16 for instance, you can see the 
outlines of the various sliders around the keyboard and touchpad. In addition, you can clearly see the outlines of each expansion card on the laptop.</p>

<p>On a very positive note, you can swap the expansion cards to fit your needs and for those who care about colors, you can easily swap the colors of the screen bezel and the panels surrounding 
the keyboard such as adding a numpad, swapping the keyboard for an RGB keyboard, or getting an LED matrix panel. The flexibility to change the expansion cards was the biggest appeal 
of the laptop for me as you get to choose which IO ports will be HDMI, USB-As, or USB-Cs (with some restrictions).</p>

<p>I should keep this more brief as this is a microblog … Anyhow, now that I have access to my first dedicated GPU, I can now play video games that isn’t Minesweeper, Solitaire, 
Starcraft (Broodwar) and PC ports of old games like Final Fantasy 7. Ever since players were forced to move onto Counterstrike 2, I was no longer able to play CounterStrike with my old Lenovo Gen 7 X1 Carbon 
laptop. I was surprised by how noisy the laptop can be when playing Counterstrike 2 though that is likely due to my inexperience playing videogames that requires a dedicated GPU (and 
I am playing on a laptop which is probably not the best idea if you want to play videogames). 
Here’s the specs:</p>

<p>I previously mentioned that <a href="./jekyll-cache">I lost my file</a> by accidentally overwriting my file using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> command. This got me thinking as to why this would be impossible on 
my work laptop since I would be constantly bombarded with a prompt to confirm my intention to overwrite the file.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cp 2024-12-01-template.md 2024-12-30-alias-interactive.md
cp: overwrite '2024-12-30-alias-interactive.md'?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Commands like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> have an <strong>interactive</strong> flag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-i</code> to prompt before overwriting the file. As seen in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man 1 cp</code></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>-i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite (overrides a previous -n option)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To force everyone at work to have this flag enabled, they made <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code> an alias in our default shell configs:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">alias cp</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"cp -i"</span>
<span class="nb">alias mv</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"mv -i"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which you can also verify using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code> command:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ type cp
cp is aliased to `cp -i'
$ type mv
mv is aliased to `mv -i'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Years ago I was once asked by an intern to debug a mysterious crash that seemed so innocent. While I no longer recall what the code was about, we stripped the program to a single line in 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>. Yet the program still continued to crash.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">buf</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1024</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">1024</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">1024</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># ./prog-arm64 

Process 630803 (prog-arm64) terminated SIGSEGV code=1 fltno=11 ip=00000025333267f0 mapaddr=00000000000007f0 ref=000000443dd5dc50
Memory fault (core dumped) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This bewildered all of the interns as it made absolutely no sense. Through our investigation, there was two things we noticed:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The program worked on our local machines but not on our target virtual machine</li>
  <li>We were allocating an extremely large buffer in the stack which was unusual</li>
</ol>

<p>It turns out the intern wanted to allocate a 1MiB buffer for some networking or driver related ticket. If I recall correctly, our target 
only had 512MB RAM so this could have explained the mysterious crash. But even 1MiB buffer on the stack was too large for our target:</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">buf</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1024</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">1024</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># ./prog-arm64 

Process 696339 (prog-arm64) terminated SIGSEGV code=1 fltno=11 ip=0000004de7e7a7ec mapaddr=00000000000007ec ref=000000383b19fbe0
Memory fault (core dumped) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One thing I purposely omitted was that our target was running QNX, a realtime operating system. If we were to take a look at the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A process’s main thread starts with an automatically allocated 512 KB stack
– <a href="https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.prog/topic/process_stack.html">QNX SDP 8.0 - Stack Allocation</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This shocked all of us since 1 MiB is not a large buffer in 2021 where we had plenty of memory on our own personal system at home.</p>

<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> The target used in the example was an aarch64le. This example will work on amd64 (x86_64) but requires you to add something such as a print statement</p>

<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> QNX 8.0 was released to the general public in late 2023 or early 2024 so the actual target at the time when the question was asked was running either QNX 7.0 or QNX 7.1 (I do not recall which version)</p>

<p>The behavior for AMD64 (x86_64) as noted requires more fiddling to trigger a crash which came to my surprise. A slightly more detailed version will be released shortly on my <a href="https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog/small-stack/">blog</a> 
which will include a very brief reason as to why AMD64 doesn’t crash if nothing extra is added like a call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">puts</code>.</p>

<p>I was in the midst of publishing a post on announcing that QNX released a non-commercial license which allows hobbyist to fiddle around 
but I accidentally deleted my file using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> command. This effectively killed my mood as I did not want to rewrite everything 
from scratch. I then recall that Jekyll creates a cache to speed up the build process when converting markdown to HTML.</p>

<pre class="highlight" style="background-color: #1b1b1b; padding: .5rem; line-height: 1.25em">$ ls -ld .?*

<p>If we were to traverse into the cache and into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jekyll-Converters--Markdown</code>, you’ll see a lot of directories labelled what it appears to be in hex:</p>

<p>Using my trust tool <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code>, I was able to patch up pieces of my work. However, as the purpose of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jekyll-Converters--Markdown</code> is to 
cache markdown files that have been converted to HTML, I obviously had to clean it up a bit but regardless, it was much faster than

<p>Recently on Hackernews, a relations developer from QNX announced that <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42079460">QNX is now free for anything non-commercial</a>. QNX also made an annoncement
to the LinkedIn Community as well which was where I learned about it.
For those who are not familiar with QNX, QNX is a properiety realtime operating system targetted for embedded systems and is installed in over 255 million vehicles.
QNX has a great reputation for being reliable and safe embedded system to build software on top of due to its microarchitecture and compliance to many industrial and engineering design process
which gives customers the ability to certify their software in safety critical systems more easily. What makes QNX appealing is a discussion on another time but for me, this is a good
opportunity to fiddle around with the system. I was <a href="https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog/carletonu-qnx-license/">previously denied a license</a> from my university who had an agreement with QNX and
my attempts to get an educational license did not go far years ago.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/micro/products/qnx/announcement-linkedin.png" alt="LinkedIn Post announcing QNX 8.0 has a non-commercial license" /></p>

<p>Previously to gain access to QNX, one would have to either purchase a commericial license from QNX or have an academic license. This made hobbyists from having access to the operating system.
With the non-commericial license, QNX is now open for those who are interested in running a RTOS in their hobby projects and for open source developers to port their software on QNX. QNX is a
POSIX compliant software but as QNX was not open for public use, companies had to port open source projects into QNX such as ROS (Robotics Operating System which isn’t an actual OS). QNX
also mentions the non-commercial license allows one to develop training materials and books on utilizing QNX which is frankly scarce outside of QNX authorized materials (i.e. QNX training, Foundary27, and
QNX Documentation).</p>

<p>While the announcement is welcoming news for me who would love to tinker around, this is yet another product entering the hobbyist community late. The reason for the success of UNIX, Linux, RISCV, and ARM is the ease and
availability of the product to hobbyists and students who later bring this to their workplace or make the product better. Closing access to technology is a receipe for disaster in the long-term in terms of
gaining market advantage. This is exactly the reason why we see cloud corporations enticing either the student or the hobbyist population to have free (limited) access to their products and even at times
sponsor events targeted towards them. Linux, BSD, and FreeRTOS being open source makes them the dominant OS among the tinkering community and have wide adoption in the market. Over the years, we have seen a
shift from customers using commercial and custom grade hardware and software towards more open source or off the shelf solutions including on critical safety applications such as those on SpaceX using Linux and
non radiation hardened CPUs. IBM for instance has been late to developing an ecosystem of developers for their Cloud, Database and Power Architecture. IBM over the recent years has done a good job in creating free
developer focused trainings which tries to make use of their own technologies. However, it is plain obvious that IBM has failed to capture mainstream interest of hobbyists who much prefer other cloud providers such as
AWS, Google Cloud, Linode, and Digital Ocean. The SPARC and POWER architectures were open-source far too late by their own respective owners that developers have shifted towards RISCV and ARM as those architectures
are either more open or easier to obtain (such as through Raspberry Pi Foundation).</p>

<p>While I have not done any sentimental analysis of this announcement, I think overall this move is a good first step to develop an ecosystem of developers who appreciate and understand the QNX architecture but is also
met with sketpicism. For reference, QNX has messed with the community twice before which explains the big mistrust from experienced developers. The top comment on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42079460">Hackernews</a>
does a great job summarizing the sketpicism. QNX used to have a bigger hobbyist community in the past where open source projects such as Firefox would have a build for QNX, but that all died when QNX closed their doors
to the community. Years later, QNX source code was available for the public to read (though probably with restrictions) but later shut the source code availability after being acquired by Blackberry who does not have the
best reputation to the developer community (hence why Blackberry Phones failed to capture the market from my understanding despite once being a market leader).</p>

<p>Regardless, I have plans to create a few materials on QNX in the coming months and perhaps create a follow up to <a href="https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog/qnx-aps/">QNX Adapative Partitioning System</a> as it seemed to have gained enough
has been ranked top 5 on Google search results (though I doubt it had many readers due to the population of QNX developers):</p>

<p>I noticed that the neocities community love using protonmail and some even share their public key to enable full encryption communication. 
While I care about cyber security more than the average human, I do not care enough to start requiring others to start encrypting their 
email and sign their messages so that I can verify the authenticity of the messages I receieve.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I decided to see how one would manually verify the signature of an email to ensure that the email has not been tampered with 
and comes from the person who it claims to be. I won’t go into how digital signatures work as those details will be posted shortly after at 
my <a href="https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog/signature-verification/">blog</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Import Alice’s public key:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gpg --import publickey-alice@proton.me.asc 
gpg: key &lt;redacted&gt;: public key "alice@proton.me &lt;alice@proton.me&gt;" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Download the email <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.eml</code> file and the signature
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ls signature.asc 'GPG Signing test.eml'
'GPG Signing test.eml'   signature.asc
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extract the message to verify from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.eml</code> file</p>

    <p>This is where things get difficult. The downloaded email <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.eml</code> has a lots of unnedded information that needs to be discarded. 
 I highly recommend that you make a copy of the email file because it does take a while to get used to.</p>

    <p>The content of the message starts after you see the following header (the hash will differ):</p>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> This is an OpenPGP/MIME signed message (RFC 4880 and 3156)
 --------7005887d7abcdefgbe09e18825fd164103abcdefgf8c40b59382649cd69bc70a
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>So for instance, let’s look at the following file:</p>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> MIME-Version: 1.0
 Content-Type: multipart/signed; protocol="application/pgp-signature"; micalg=pgp-sha512; boundary="------3141887d7abcdefgbe09e18825fd164103abcdefgf8c40b59382649cd69b31415"; charset=utf-8

 This is an OpenPGP/MIME signed message (RFC 4880 and 3156)
 --------3141887d7abcdefgbe09e18825fd164103abcdefgf8c40b59382649cd69b31415
 Content-Type: multipart/mixed;boundary=---------------------ff35159c3ebf11234dd954191b3141592
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Then the first line of the signed message is:</p>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> Content-Type: multipart/mixed;boundary=---------------------ff35159c3ebf11234dd954191b3141592
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Where the signed message ends is a scene of confusion. On the internet, there are many that says you to put everything between the first boundary and the second boundary into 
 a new file. The boundary they are referring to is the line after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">This is an OpenPGP/MIME signed message (RFC 4880 and 3156)</code> which has the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">----&lt;hash&gt;</code>.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> --------3141887d7abcdefgbe09e18825fd164103abcdefgf8c40b59382649cd69b31415

 //email content

 --------3141887d7abcdefgbe09e18825fd164103abcdefgf8c40b59382649cd69b31415
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Despite my many attempts, I had no success till I realized you have to delete all trailing new lines. One thing I notice is that the hash on the first line of the signed message
 is also the last line in the signed message.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> Content-Type: multipart/mixed;boundary=---------------------ff35159c3ebf11234dd954191b3141592
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p class="caption"> The first line of the signed file</p>

    <p>The hash on the first line of the signed message is: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ff35159c3ebf11234dd954191b3141592</code> so our file should also end with this hash.</p>

    <p>If our message looks something like this:</p>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> MIME-Version: 1.0
 Content-Type: multipart/signed; protocol="application/pgp-signature"; micalg=pgp-sha512; boundary="------3141887d7abcdefgbe09e18825fd164103abcdefgf8c40b59382649cd69b31415"; charset=utf-8

<p>In practice, no one verifies the digital signatures of emails manually. Any sane individual will utilize any email client that would automate the verification process for 
them. This was a quick preview of a <a href="https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog/signature-verification/">blog post</a> I will be writing in the next few days that will go into email signatures in more details 
with better explanations and diagrams.</p>

<p>Those of us who live and speak English will probably never think about how characters are encoded which is how characters such as the 
very letters you see in the screen are represented by being given some number like 65 for ‘A’ in ASCII which takes 1 byte to be represented 
such as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">char</code> in C.</p>

<p>I was not aware of the existence of full-width and half-width characters till the friend asked me to briefly explain the highlevel 
information about the difference in representing the characters. For those like me who weren’t aware that the Japanese mix between 
zenkaku (full-width) and hankaku (half-width) characters, look at the image below or visit this webpage: <a href="https://mailmate.jp/blog/half-width-full-width-hankaku-zenkaku-explained">https://mailmate.jp/blog/half-width-full-width-hankaku-zenkaku-explained</a></p>

<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/rrofptqvevic/3276rMt8nR8HEVYYAhhZvV/633c276e889c8dd101c4ea89cc07f82d/image_-_2023-07-21T105935.292.webp" alt="An image displaying the difference between full and half-width characters" /></p>

<p>Based on the article I shared, half-width characters takes up 1 byte while full-width characters takes up 2 bytes (also can be called double byte character). 
I do believe this depends on 
the encoding used. For me, the most obvious distinction between half and full width characters is how much graphical space it consumes as 
evident from both the image above and below:</p>

<p><img src="https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog../assets/micro/programming/encoding/full-half-width.png" alt="Full and Half Width Characters encoded on UTF-8" /></p>
<p class="caption">Full and Half Width encoded on UTF-8 as seen through Vim</p>

<p>While I have read and typed Korean during my younger years when I was forced to learn Korean, it never clicked to me how much space Korean 
takes up graphically. It is obvious in hindsight but it was nonetheless interesting. Taking a look at the size and bytes encoding, we can 
see that number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> in UTF-8 encoding takes 1 and 3 bytes for half-width and full-width character repsectively</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ stat -c "%n,%s" -- halfwidth-utf8.txt fullwidth-utf8.txt 
halfwidth-utf8.txt,1
fullwidth-utf8.txt,3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One confusion I had was understanding what the difference between UTF-8 and UTF-16 and the following excercise helped me understand this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>UTF-8 encodes each character between 1-4 bytes</li>
  <li>UTF-16 encodes each characters between 2-4 bytes</li>
</ul>

<p>UTF-8 and UTF-16 as you can tell are variable length meaning they take up more or less bytes depending on the character being encoded. We can 
see this by comparing the number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> arabic numeral v.s. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">一</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ stat -c "%n,%s" -- halfwidth-1.txt chinese-1.md 
halfwidth-1.txt,1
chinese-1.md,3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In UTF-8, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> takes up 1 byte which is unsurprising as ASCII has great advantage in UTF-8 compared to other Asian languages.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not attempt to display UTF-16 encoded files on the terminal without changing your locale (or whatever it is called). It will not display nicely. Vim on my machine will automatically open the file as UTF-16LE.</p>

<p><img src="https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog../assets/micro/programming/encoding/chinese-garbage.png" alt="My default terminal settings is unable to display the content in Chinese properly" /></p>

<p>Let’s inspect the contents of the files between Half character <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> and Full Byte Character <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">１</code> in HEX:</p>
<pre class="highlight" style="background-color: #1b1b1b; padding: .5rem; line-height: 1.25em"><font color="#D0CFCC"><b>$ </b></font>cat halfwidth-1.txt; echo &quot;&quot;; xxd halfwidth-1.txt; cat fullwidth-1.txt ; echo &quot;&quot;; xxd fullwidth-1.txt 
1
00000000: <font color="#26A269"><b>31</b></font>                      <font color="#C01C28"><b>               </b></font>  <font color="#26A269"><b>1</b></font>
１
00000000: <font color="#C01C28"><b>efbc</b></font> <font color="#C01C28"><b>91</b></font>                   <font color="#C01C28"><b>             </b></font>  <font color="#C01C28"><b>...</b></font>
</pre>

<p>As we can see, the half-width character <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> in UTF-8 is represented as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x31</code> meaning only one byte would be required. However, a full-width 
digit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">１</code> is represented as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xEFBC91</code>. Now let’s compared this with UTF-16:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cat halfwidth-utf16.txt; echo ; xxd halfwidth-utf16.txt; cat fullwidth-utf16.txt; echo; xxd fullwidth-utf16.txt 
1
00000000: 0031                                     .1
�
00000000: ff11                                     ..
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To view UTF-16 on VIM run on command mode (i.e. press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">esc</code> to exit current mode and press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:</code> to enter command mode): <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e ++enc=utf-16be fullwidth-utf16.txt</code></p>

<p>As expected, UTF-16 represents code points in the upper range very well where we now see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">１</code> (full-width 1) being represented with only 2 bytes unlike the 3 that was required in UTF-8. 
Though the same cannot be said for code points in the lower range such as our half-width digit 	<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> which now takes 2 bytes by appending <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x00</code> to its hex representation.</p>

<p>I will be writing a more detailed look into encoding at my <a href="https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog/halfwidth-fullwidth-encoding/">blog</a> in the coming days. This is just a quick preview.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://tmendez.dev/posts/rng-git-hash-bug/">recent post</a> has gotten somewhat popular on the web and is something many of us could
somewhat relate with. In the case of many including the author, the issue stems from how YAML treats strings and numbers. As a rule of
thumb, I would always suggest avoiding any potential confusion by always adding the quotes around a string to ensure the value is treated
as a string as intended. The crux of the post was how their Git commit inconveniently happened to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">556474e378</code> which is very rare 
to obtain. Recall that scientific notation is in the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\d+(\.\d+)?E-?\d+</code> such as 8.5E-10 to refer to 8.5 x 10<sup>-10</sup>.
The issue that one may encounter when mixing numbers and strings is that things can go very unexpected like the author did whereby
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">556474e378</code> was treated as 556474 x 10<sup>378</sup>. While I do not have any specific examples in mind when I have encountered such issues, 
I definitely have encountered this issue before where I mixed up a string and a number and obtained an undesired behavior. However, 
I do not think I ever encountered an issue where my numbers were interpreted as scientific notations.</p>

<p>I recently learned that websites can be terminated with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> such as <a href="www.google.com."><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.google.com.</code></a> or <a href="https://neocities.org."><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://neocities.org.</code></a>. 
However, this does not work <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/09/12/why-do-domain-names-end-with-a-dot-/">for all websites</a>. I was skimming through <em>Network for Dummies</em> 
during work and while it doesn’t cover anything useful for the work I am trying to do (if you have taken a network course before, don’t bother reading this book unless 
you were bored like I was<sup>1</sup>), terminating a website with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> was a surprise.</p>

<p>The book states that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If a domain name ends with a trailing dot, ..., and the domain name is said to be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)</code>.
The difference between an absolute name (FQDN) and relative name is important when working with DNS and can cause an “internet outage” if 
done incorrectly as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32862913">one user on hackernews</a> comments. Based on some <a href="http://www.dns-sd.org/trailingdotsindomainnames.html">article</a> 
(<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36931853/if-there-exists-a-dot-after-com-is-it-a-valid-url">linked by a stackoverflow user</a>), websites that fail 
to handle <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> in their domain names are the ones who are in violation of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt">RFC 1738</a> or at least not heeding 
to its recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> While Network for Dummies was actually fun to read surprisingly due to the author’s writing style, it lacks technical depth which should come to no surprise.</p>

<p>During the winter break I have obtained an old Xerox XE88 Workstation Printer released in the year of 2000, the year where the media were 
worried about Y2K causing havok to our digital infrastructure which never came to the scale we all feared thankfully. Though of course 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident">a bug will eventually will creep and wreck havok</a>(i.e. Crowdstrike Falcon Update). 
But I digress, using this printer was filled with frustration as it is a relic from the past that is not meant to be used in 2024. 
Firstly, the printer requires a parallel port which no modern computer comes equip with. I have to drag out my last surviving desktop from my childhood that originally came with 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Me">Windows Me</a> that we immediately switched to the glorious Windows XP that we all know, love and 
dearly miss. As it turns out a few months later after my first use of the printer, my PS/2 connected mouse stopped working. I do not know if 
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS/2_port">PS/2 port</a> is broken or if my PS/2 mouse is broken. I did manage to find another PS/2 mouse but as it was water damaged from a basement 
leak a few years ago, there was little chance it would work. Without a mouse made this task much harder, but I digress.</p>

<p>Placing aside the hardware struggles to operate such printer in 2024, the printer does not have duplex printing so I had run commands on my 
pdfs on my Linux machine before transferring the files to my Windows XP machine (thankfully there are USB ports on this desktop that work 
or else I would have to dust off my 3.5 inch floppy disks and CDs). To split pdfs into even and odd pages turns out to be a very simple 
command:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">pdftk <span class="nv">A</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">file</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="nb">cat </span>Aodd output <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">file</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">-odd.pdf"</span>

<p>As I am printing a bunch of papers on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Computing">Trusted Computing</a>, I needed to split a lot of PDFs 
so this task can get quite tedious so I wrote a simple shell script:</p>

<p>I recently came across an <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/982085/">article</a> discussing an attempt to close a loophole bypassing the normal 
execution permission bit. Exploiting a program suid and euid to gain high privilige is a commonly known technique called privilege 
escalation. This article does not cover this but it introduces a flaw in the current way Linux handles the execution of scripts. I 
do not know why privilige escalation came to my mind but as I usually write nonesensical things anyways, I shall keep it here for now. The article gives a neat 
example where a script does not have execution bit but is still executable by invoking the script via an interpreter.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ls -l evil-script.py 
-rw-r--r--. 1 zaku zaku 86 Aug 28 00:20 evil-script.py
$ ./evil-script.py
bash: ./evil-script.py: Permission denied
$ python3 evil-script.py 
Evil script has been invoked. Terror shall fill this land
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the script has no execute bit set. However, the script is still executable by feeding the script to the interpreter.
I have never considered this a security loophole but after reading the article, I realized there are some concerns of allowing scripts 
to be executable bypassing the file’s permission. I have always made the habit of running many of the interpreted scripts non-executable 
and fed them to the interpreter due to laziness (I know it’s a one time thing to set the execute bit but I am just lazy to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod</code>).</p>

<p>The article covers some promising approaches so I do expect a solution to be merged into the kernel sometime in the near future which will 
force me to change my habits once the interpreters make the change. Though if interpreters do make this patch, I do expect quite a few 
production and CI/CD servers to be impacted as there will always be someone like me who are lazy to set the execute bit on our scripts.</p>

<p>One benefit of closing this loophole is to force users to deliberately make the conscious choice to set the execute bit similar to how we have to 
set the flatpaks we download as executables (at least from my personal experience) before we can execute the flatpaks.</p>

<p>Any beginner C programmer will know that the first function executed in any program is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> function. However, that is not the entire 
truth. Just like how we have learned the Bohr and Lewis diagrams in Chemistry in Highschool, this is an oversimplification.  From my knowledge, 
the first function executed once the loader runs in a binary is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_start()</code>.</p>

<p>Without going into any details, we can replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> with another function such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo()</code> (sorry for the lack of creativity).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Called foo</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">exit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Called main</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we compile with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-e &lt;entry&gt;</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;entry&gt;</code> is the name of the function replacing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code>, we can see the following results:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gcc foo.c -e foo
$ ./a.out 
Called foo
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can also observe from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">objdump</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nm</code> to see where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start_address</code> of the C code is (here I am making a distinction between the 
first entry point of the C code and the binary).</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code><font color="#D0CFCC"><b>$ </b></font> objdump -f ./a.out | grep start
start address <font color="#C01C28"><b>0x0000000000401136</b></font>
<font color="#D0CFCC"><b>$ </b></font>nm ./a.out | grep foo
<b><font color="#C01C28">0000000000401136 T</font></b> foo</code></pre>

<h3 id="few-notes">Few Notes</h3>
<ol>
  <li>You must define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> even if it’s not going to be used. <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/main_function">CPP Reference</a> states 
this explicitly:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Every C program coded to run in a hosted execution environment contains the definition (not the prototype) of a function named main, which is the designated start of the program.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Neglecting to define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> results in an error like the following:</p>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gcc foo.c
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/14/../../../../lib64/crt1.o: in function `_start':
(.text+0x1b): undefined reference to `main'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>The C program entry must call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit()</code> to terminate if it is not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> or else a segfault will occur
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./a.out 
Called foo
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>a backtrace via gdb won’t give much information as to why. Probably best to consult with glibc. Essentially it is likely due to the fact 
that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_start</code> is not a function that returns in the stack. It calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code> to terminate the program which probably does some cleaning via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atexit</code> 
and set the exit status <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$?</code> to some value.</p>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) bt 
#0  0x0000000000000001 in ?? ()
#1  0x00007fffffffdd46 in ?? ()

<h1 class="title">Editing GIFS and Creating 88x31 Buttons</h1>

<p>Lately I have been learning how to edit GIFS and it is painstaking difficult to remove a background from a GIF without using an 
AI tool, especially when the image has over 70 frames. There is likely an easier way to edit GIFs but I had to manually edit over 50 
frames, erasing the clouds from a GIF using the eraser tool frame by frame which took some time to finish. <br /></p>

<p><b>Original:</b></p>

<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="26494068" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="2.19178" data-width="100%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/flying-pikachu-transparent-balloon-pikachu-pokemon-yellow-pikachu-pokemon-gif-26494068">Flying Pikachu Transparent Balloon Pikachu Sticker</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/flying+pikachu+transparent-stickers">Flying Pikachu Transparent Stickers</a></div>
<script type="text/javascript" async="" src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

<p><b>Result:</b></p>

<p><img src="../assets/micro/gifs/flying-pikachu-3.gif" /></p>

<p>However, if you are not editing a GIF 
but rather trying to incorporate the GIF into your 88x31 buttons, it turns out to be quite simple. Following the instructions from 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XfrnY4mb5o">a video on Youtube</a>, I managed to create a few simple 88x31 buttons that have 
features cats, coffee, and the two programs I am or finished studying (i.e. doing a 2nd degree):</p>

<div class="quick-badges">
<div><img src="../assets/micro/buttons/coffee-powered.gif" /></div>
<div><img src="../assets/micro/buttons/cs-cat.gif" /></div>
<div><img src="../assets/micro/buttons/math-major.gif" /></div>
</div>

<p>To resize the gifs, I used <a href="https://ezgif.com/resize">ezgif resize tool</a> to set the height to be 31px since I didn’t know 
how to resize GIFs on GIMP as it would open a bunch of layers. I guess I could have used ffmpeg but using an online tool is just more 
convenient and easier. I do wonder if there are other standard anti-pixel button sizes aside from 80x15 pixels because a height of 
31 pixels is quite limiting. It’s amazing what the community has been able to do with such limiting number of pixels.</p>

<div class="quick-badges">
<div><img src="../assets/micro/buttons/c.png" /></div>
<div><img src="../assets/micro/buttons/perl.png" /></div>
<div><img src="../assets/micro/buttons/bash.png" /></div>
<div><img src="../assets/micro/buttons/latex.png" /></div>
</div>

<p>For instance, the Bash button I have made has the subtitle “THE BOURNE-AGAIN SHELL” which is very hard to make out. I am assuming the standard 
practice is to render the button as a GIF and display the text on the next frame. That way users would be able to see the full-text.</p>

<p>Randomly I decided to compile some old projects I worked on and I was surprised to see a few 
compilation errors in an assembler I wrote years back. As it has been many years since I last touched most of the projects I looked at, I was 
pleased to see the compiler catching obvious mistakes I had made in the past. Though this did come to a surprise as to why the compiler I used 
years ago never complained such obvious mistakes. The solution and reason for the last compilation error was not immediate to me:</p>

<pre><code>$ make
gcc -o assembler assembler.c symbol_table.c parser.c  -fsanitize=address -lasan
/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/cc1MoBol.o:(.bss+0x0): multiple definition of `table'; /tmp/cc0B4XxW.o:(.bss+0x0): first defined here
/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/cc1MoBol.o:(.bss+0x81): multiple definition of `__odr_asan.table'; /tmp/cc0B4XxW.o:(.bss+0x40): first defined here</code></pre>

<p>At first I thought I may had made a stupid mistake and defined the struct called <i>table</i> twice but all I could find was <code>symbol_table.h</code>, the file that declared the variable, 
being included by <code>assembler.c</code> and <code>parser.c</code>. This led to the conclusion there must have been a compiler behavioral change between GCC 9 and 
GCC 14. After a quick googling and going through going through the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/changes.html">Release Notes</a>, it turns out that starting from 
GCC 10, <code>GCC now defaults to -fno-common</code>:</p>

<blockquote>GCC now defaults to -fno-common. As a result, global variable accesses are more efficient on various targets. In C, global variables with multiple tentative definitions now result in linker errors. With -fcommon such definitions are silently merged during linking.
</blockquote>

<p>In the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html">Porting to GCC 10</a> webpage, the developers of GCC notes:</p>

<blockquote>
A common mistake in C is omitting extern when declaring a global variable in a header file. If the header is included by several files it results in multiple definitions of the same variable
</blockquote>

<p>To resolve this issue, one can either silently ignore their mistake and compile with <code>-fcommon</code> or to correctly declare the global variable with the <code>extern</code> keyword.</p>

<p>Framework is a company that makes modular and repairable laptops that has captured the interests of tech enthusiasts over the past 4 years. 
Currently Framework laptops are limited to x86-64 architecture supporting Intel and later AMD CPUs in 2023. Although Framework laptops are not 
entirely open source, they have <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer">open source a decent chunk of their work</a> from my understanding and 
which allows third party development of components and makes partnership possible for other companies such as 
<a href="https://frame.work/ca/en/blog/introducing-a-new-risc-v-mainboard-from-deepcomputing" alt="Framework announcement of introducing a RISC-V mainboard">
DeepComputing to release a mainboard that runs a RISC-V CPU
</a>. While the new mainboard will not be usable for everyday applications, it is a step forward to a more open ecosystem and this is an exciting step for both 
Framework, RISC-V and the broader open-advocate community. This announcement makes me wonder the possibility of OpenPower running on a Framework laptop. 
Similarly to RISC-V, there isn’t an easily accessible way to obtain a consumer product running on OpenPower (aside from Raptor Computing with their 
extremely expensive machines). There is the 
<a href="https://www.powerpc-notebook.org/en/" alt="PowerPC NoteBook Community Page">
PowerPC Notebook project
</a> ran by a group of volunteers who are trying to develop an open source PowerPC notebook to the hands of hobbyists. It would be interesting 
if OpenPower community could also partner with Framework to develop a mainboard once the project is complete and the software is more matured. 
However, this would be a difficult step as there is no dedicated company like DeepComputing that will pour resources into making this happen. 
The interest into OpenPower is low and overshadowed by the wider industry interest in expanding the ARM and RISC-V architecture to consumers. 
IBM made a huge mistake in open sourcing the POWER architecture too late. But one could always dream (even if it’s delusional) :D</p>

In the past year I have been very lazy as evident with my <a href="https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog/" alt="Personal Blog">lack of activity on my personal blog</a>.
I'm now trying to pick up blogging again. It's hard to believe that it's been almost an entire year since I created this neocity site, which has almost 0 updates since. 
I've been thinking about how to use this site since I already have a blog on GitHub Pages. Honestly, I forgot this corner existed, and it’s been bothering me that I couldn’t write my random, nonsensical thoughts because my main blog wouldn’t be a suitable medium until now.
So, I’ve decided that this corner will be a microblog where I can share random articles and thoughts. A microblog is different from a regular blog in that the content is much shorter. This space will allow me to quickly jot down something random. I hope that a collection of these random posts will evolve into a blog post or spark an idea for my final year thesis or project.
<p />

<b>How are my studies going?</b><br />
<p>
I’m still studying Mathematics, but I’ve lost much of my initial interest in the field after taking a few third-year courses. 
I ended up taking fewer Math courses, which puts my ability to graduate on time at risk. 
Listening to lectures and reading about abstract groups and rings made me really miss programming and computer science. 
<img src="../assets/micro/gifs/onion/study-confused.gif" />
Despite this, there were still some Math courses I enjoyed, such as Combinatorics and Real Analysis. 
However, I didn’t last long in the follow-up Real Analysis courses that covered Stone-Weierstrass and Commutative C* Algebra. 
Feeling tired of abstract Mathematics, I decided to take a break and pursue an internship at a telecommunications enterprise.</p>

<img src="../assets/micro/gifs/graph-retro-computer.webp" alt="retro computer fiddling with excel" />

<b>What am I doing Now?</b><br />
<p>As mentioned, I am currently doing a year-long internship with a telecommunications enterprise. Although the job isn't very exciting, it's a welcome break from Mathematics. This would typically be a great chance to catch up on my Computer Science studies by delving into textbooks and online resources, but I’ve been quite lazy. Instead, I've been focusing on learning French, a language I've always wanted to master. I started learning French in elementary school, as it’s a requirement in Canada. While it might make more sense to learn my mother tongue, I’m opting to learn French, which might seem confusing to some. For context, I don't have an English name and was born in some Asian country but I am unable to communicate with others in my mother tongue.</p>
