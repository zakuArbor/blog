  <h1>August Edition</h1>

I recently started microblogging on neocities, a project that tries to bring back the <s>chaos</s> creativity back to the internet like 
the now defunct Geocities, as [randombits](https://randombits.neocities.org/). As the name implies, [randombits](https://randombits.neocities.org/) 
is a webpage of random bits of thoughts and updates. It's a forum where I will share short bits that are both quick to write and can be 
a bit more personal.

**Note:** Do not be surprised if the formatting is broken as I am simply copying the HTML code from  my neocities website along with the 
minimal CSS I think will be needed. The links below go to the individual webpage on neocities. You'll need to scroll down to see the desired 
post if you do not want to be redirected to another site.

<p>I recently learned that websites can be terminated with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> such as <a href="www.google.com."><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.google.com.</code></a> or <a href="https://neocities.org."><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://neocities.org.</code></a>. 
However, this does not work <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/09/12/why-do-domain-names-end-with-a-dot-/">for all websites</a>. I was skimming through <em>Network for Dummies</em> 
during work and while it doesn’t cover anything useful for the work I am trying to do (if you have taken a network course before, don’t bother reading this book unless 
you were bored like I was<sup>1</sup>), terminating a website with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> was a surprise.</p>

<p>The book states that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If a domain name ends with a trailing dot, ..., and the domain name is said to be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)</code>.
The difference between an absolute name (FQDN) and relative name is important when working with DNS and can cause an “internet outage” if 
done incorrectly as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32862913">one user on hackernews</a> comments. Based on some <a href="http://www.dns-sd.org/trailingdotsindomainnames.html">article</a> 
(<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36931853/if-there-exists-a-dot-after-com-is-it-a-valid-url">linked by a stackoverflow user</a>), websites that fail 
to handle <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> in their domain names are the ones who are in violation of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt">RFC 1738</a> or at least not heeding 
to its recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> While Network for Dummies was actually fun to read surprisingly due to the author’s writing style, it lacks technical depth which should come to no surprise.</p>

<p>During the winter break I have obtained an old Xerox XE88 Workstation Printer released in the year of 2000, the year where the media were 
worried about Y2K causing havok to our digital infrastructure which never came to the scale we all feared thankfully. Though of course 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident">a bug will eventually will creep and wreck havok</a>(i.e. Crowdstrike Falcon Update). 
But I digress, using this printer was filled with frustration as it is a relic from the past that is not meant to be used in 2024. 
Firstly, the printer requires a parallel port which no modern computer comes equip with. I have to drag out my last surviving desktop from my childhood that originally came with 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Me">Windows Me</a> that we immediately switched to the glorious Windows XP that we all know, love and 
dearly miss. As it turns out a few months later after my first use of the printer, my PS/2 connected mouse stopped working. I do not know if 
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS/2_port">PS/2 port</a> is broken or if my PS/2 mouse is broken. I did manage to find another PS/2 mouse but as it was water damaged from a basement 
leak a few years ago, there was little chance it would work. Without a mouse made this task much harder, but I digress.</p>

</div>

<p>Placing aside the hardware struggles to operate such printer in 2024, the printer does not have duplex printing so I had run commands on my 
pdfs on my Linux machine before transferring the files to my Windows XP machine (thankfully there are USB ports on this desktop that work 
or else I would have to dust off my 3.5 inch floppy disks and CDs). To split pdfs into even and odd pages turns out to be a very simple 
command:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">pdftk <span class="nv">A</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">file</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="nb">cat </span>Aodd output <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">file</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">-odd.pdf"</span>

<p>As I am printing a bunch of papers on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Computing">Trusted Computing</a>, I needed to split a lot of PDFs 
so this task can get quite tedious so I wrote a simple shell script:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="k">for </span>file <span class="k">in</span> <span class="k">*</span>pdf<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do

<p>I recently came across an <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/982085/">article</a> discussing an attempt to close a loophole bypassing the normal 
execution permission bit. Exploiting a program suid and euid to gain high privilige is a commonly known technique called privilege 
escalation. This article does not cover this but it introduces a flaw in the current way Linux handles the execution of scripts. I 
do not know why privilige escalation came to my mind but as I usually write nonesensical things anyways, I shall keep it here for now. The article gives a neat 
example where a script does not have execution bit but is still executable by invoking the script via an interpreter.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ls -l evil-script.py 
-rw-r--r--. 1 zaku zaku 86 Aug 28 00:20 evil-script.py
$ ./evil-script.py
bash: ./evil-script.py: Permission denied
$ python3 evil-script.py 
Evil script has been invoked. Terror shall fill this land
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the script has no execute bit set. However, the script is still executable by feeding the script to the interpreter.
I have never considered this a security loophole but after reading the article, I realized there are some concerns of allowing scripts 
to be executable bypassing the file’s permission. I have always made the habit of running many of the interpreted scripts non-executable 
and fed them to the interpreter due to laziness (I know it’s a one time thing to set the execute bit but I am just lazy to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod</code>).</p>

<p>The article covers some promising approaches so I do expect a solution to be merged into the kernel sometime in the near future which will 
force me to change my habits once the interpreters make the change. Though if interpreters do make this patch, I do expect quite a few 
production and CI/CD servers to be impacted as there will always be someone like me who are lazy to set the execute bit on our scripts.</p>

<p>One benefit of closing this loophole is to force users to deliberately make the conscious choice to set the execute bit similar to how we have to 
set the flatpaks we download as executables (at least from my personal experience) before we can execute the flatpaks.</p>

<h1 class="title">Replacing main()</h1>

<p>Any beginner C programmer will know that the first function executed in any program is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> function. However, that is not the entire 
truth. Just like how we have learned the Bohr and Lewis diagrams in Chemistry in Highschool, this is an oversimplification.  From my knowledge, 
the first function executed once the loader runs in a binary is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_start()</code>.</p>

<p>Without going into any details, we can replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> with another function such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo()</code> (sorry for the lack of creativity).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Called foo</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">exit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Called main</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we compile with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-e &lt;entry&gt;</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;entry&gt;</code> is the name of the function replacing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code>, we can see the following results:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gcc foo.c -e foo
$ ./a.out 
Called foo
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can also observe from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">objdump</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nm</code> to see where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start_address</code> of the C code is (here I am making a distinction between the 
first entry point of the C code and the binary).</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code><font color="#D0CFCC"><b>$ </b></font> objdump -f ./a.out | grep start
start address <font color="#C01C28"><b>0x0000000000401136</b></font>
<font color="#D0CFCC"><b>$ </b></font>nm ./a.out | grep foo
<b><font color="#C01C28">0000000000401136 T</font></b> foo</code></pre>

<h3 id="few-notes">Few Notes</h3>
<ol>
  <li>You must define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> even if it’s not going to be used. <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/main_function">CPP Reference</a> states 
this explicitly:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Every C program coded to run in a hosted execution environment contains the definition (not the prototype) of a function named main, which is the designated start of the program.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Neglecting to define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> results in an error like the following:</p>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gcc foo.c
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/14/../../../../lib64/crt1.o: in function `_start':
(.text+0x1b): undefined reference to `main'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>The C program entry must call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit()</code> to terminate if it is not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code> or else a segfault will occur
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./a.out 
Called foo
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>a backtrace via gdb won’t give much information as to why. Probably best to consult with glibc. Essentially it is likely due to the fact 
that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_start</code> is not a function that returns in the stack. It calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code> to terminate the program which probably does some cleaning via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atexit</code> 
and set the exit status <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$?</code> to some value.</p>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) bt 
#0  0x0000000000000001 in ?? ()
#1  0x00007fffffffdd46 in ?? ()

<h1 class="title">Editing GIFS and Creating 88x31 Buttons</h1>

<p>Lately I have been learning how to edit GIFS and it is painstaking difficult to remove a background from a GIF without using an 
AI tool, especially when the image has over 70 frames. There is likely an easier way to edit GIFs but I had to manually edit over 50 
frames, erasing the clouds from a GIF using the eraser tool frame by frame which took some time to finish. <br></p>

<p><b>Original:</b></p>

<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="26494068" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="2.19178" data-width="100%" data-processed="true" style="width:100%;position:relative;"><div style="padding-top:45.62501710938142%;"><iframe frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://tenor.com/embed/26494068?canonicalurl=http://127.0.0.1:4000/micro/2024-august"></iframe></div></div>
<script type="text/javascript" async="" src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

<p><b>Result:</b></p>

<p><img src="https://randombits.neocities.org/assets/gifs/flying-pikachu-3.gif"></p>

<p>However, if you are not editing a GIF 
but rather trying to incorporate the GIF into your 88x31 buttons, it turns out to be quite simple. Following the instructions from 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XfrnY4mb5o">a video on Youtube</a>, I managed to create a few simple 88x31 buttons that have 
features cats, coffee, and the two programs I am or finished studying (i.e. doing a 2nd degree):</p>

<div class="quick-badges">
<div><img src="https://randombits.neocities.org/assets/buttons/coffee-powered.gif"></div>
<div><img src="https://randombits.neocities.org/assets/buttons/cs-cat.gif"></div>
<div><img src="https://randombits.neocities.org/assets/buttons/math-major.gif"></div>
</div>

<p>To resize the gifs, I used <a href="https://ezgif.com/resize">ezgif resize tool</a> to set the height to be 31px since I didn’t know 
how to resize GIFs on GIMP as it would open a bunch of layers. I guess I could have used ffmpeg but using an online tool is just more 
convenient and easier. I do wonder if there are other standard anti-pixel button sizes aside from 80x15 pixels because a height of 
31 pixels is quite limiting. It’s amazing what the community has been able to do with such limiting number of pixels.</p>

<div class="quick-badges">
<div><img src="https://randombits.neocities.org/assets/buttons/c.png"></div>
<div><img src="https://randombits.neocities.org/assets/buttons/perl.png"></div>
<div><img src="https://randombits.neocities.org/assets/buttons/bash.png"></div>
<div><img src="https://randombits.neocities.org/assets/buttons/latex.png"></div>
</div>

<p>For instance, the Bash button I have made has the subtitle “THE BOURNE-AGAIN SHELL” which is very hard to make out. I am assuming the standard 
practice is to render the button as a GIF and display the text on the next frame. That way users would be able to see the full-text.</p>

<p>Randomly I decided to compile some old projects I worked on and I was surprised to see a few 
compilation errors in an assembler I wrote years back. As it has been many years since I last touched most of the projects I looked at, I was 
pleased to see the compiler catching obvious mistakes I had made in the past. Though this did come to a surprise as to why the compiler I used 
years ago never complained such obvious mistakes. The solution and reason for the last compilation error was not immediate to me:</p>

<pre><code>$ make
gcc -o assembler assembler.c symbol_table.c parser.c  -fsanitize=address -lasan
/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/cc1MoBol.o:(.bss+0x0): multiple definition of `table'; /tmp/cc0B4XxW.o:(.bss+0x0): first defined here
/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/cc1MoBol.o:(.bss+0x81): multiple definition of `__odr_asan.table'; /tmp/cc0B4XxW.o:(.bss+0x40): first defined here</code></pre>

<p>At first I thought I may had made a stupid mistake and defined the struct called <i>table</i> twice but all I could find was <code>symbol_table.h</code>, the file that declared the variable, 
being included by <code>assembler.c</code> and <code>parser.c</code>. This led to the conclusion there must have been a compiler behavioral change between GCC 9 and 
GCC 14. After a quick googling and going through going through the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/changes.html">Release Notes</a>, it turns out that starting from 
GCC 10, <code>GCC now defaults to -fno-common</code>:</p>

<blockquote>GCC now defaults to -fno-common. As a result, global variable accesses are more efficient on various targets. In C, global variables with multiple tentative definitions now result in linker errors. With -fcommon such definitions are silently merged during linking.
</blockquote>

<p>In the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html">Porting to GCC 10</a> webpage, the developers of GCC notes:</p>

<blockquote>
A common mistake in C is omitting extern when declaring a global variable in a header file. If the header is included by several files it results in multiple definitions of the same variable
</blockquote>

<p>To resolve this issue, one can either silently ignore their mistake and compile with <code>-fcommon</code> or to correctly declare the global variable with the <code>extern</code> keyword.</p>

<p>Framework is a company that makes modular and repairable laptops that has captured the interests of tech enthusiasts over the past 4 years. 
Currently Framework laptops are limited to x86-64 architecture supporting Intel and later AMD CPUs in 2023. Although Framework laptops are not 
entirely open source, they have <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer">open source a decent chunk of their work</a> from my understanding and 
which allows third party development of components and makes partnership possible for other companies such as 
<a href="https://frame.work/ca/en/blog/introducing-a-new-risc-v-mainboard-from-deepcomputing" alt="Framework announcement of introducing a RISC-V mainboard">
DeepComputing to release a mainboard that runs a RISC-V CPU
</a>. While the new mainboard will not be usable for everyday applications, it is a step forward to a more open ecosystem and this is an exciting step for both 
Framework, RISC-V and the broader open-advocate community. This announcement makes me wonder the possibility of OpenPower running on a Framework laptop. 
Similarly to RISC-V, there isn’t an easily accessible way to obtain a consumer product running on OpenPower (aside from Raptor Computing with their 
extremely expensive machines). There is the 
<a href="https://www.powerpc-notebook.org/en/" alt="PowerPC NoteBook Community Page">
PowerPC Notebook project
</a> ran by a group of volunteers who are trying to develop an open source PowerPC notebook to the hands of hobbyists. It would be interesting 
if OpenPower community could also partner with Framework to develop a mainboard once the project is complete and the software is more matured. 
However, this would be a difficult step as there is no dedicated company like DeepComputing that will pour resources into making this happen. 
The interest into OpenPower is low and overshadowed by the wider industry interest in expanding the ARM and RISC-V architecture to consumers. 
IBM made a huge mistake in open sourcing the POWER architecture too late. But one could always dream (even if it’s delusional) :D</p>

<p><b>Website</b><br></p>
<p>
In the past year I have been very lazy as evident with my <a href="https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog/" alt="Personal Blog">lack of activity on my personal blog</a>.
I'm now trying to pick up blogging again. It's hard to believe that it's been almost an entire year since I created this neocity site, which has almost 0 updates since. 
I've been thinking about how to use this site since I already have a blog on GitHub Pages. Honestly, I forgot this corner existed, and it’s been bothering me that I couldn’t write my random, nonsensical thoughts because my main blog wouldn’t be a suitable medium until now.
So, I’ve decided that this corner will be a microblog where I can share random articles and thoughts. A microblog is different from a regular blog in that the content is much shorter. This space will allow me to quickly jot down something random. I hope that a collection of these random posts will evolve into a blog post or spark an idea for my final year thesis or project.

<b>How are my studies going?</b><br>
</p><p>
I’m still studying Mathematics, but I’ve lost much of my initial interest in the field after taking a few third-year courses. 
I ended up taking fewer Math courses, which puts my ability to graduate on time at risk. 
Listening to lectures and reading about abstract groups and rings made me really miss programming and computer science.

Despite this, there were still some Math courses I enjoyed, such as Combinatorics and Real Analysis. 
However, I didn’t last long in the follow-up Real Analysis courses that covered Stone-Weierstrass and Commutative C* Algebra. 
Feeling tired of abstract Mathematics, I decided to take a break and pursue an internship at a telecommunications enterprise.</p>

<b>What am I doing Now?</b><br>
<p>As mentioned, I am currently doing a year-long internship with a telecommunications enterprise. Although the job isn't very exciting, it's a welcome break from Mathematics. This would typically be a great chance to catch up on my Computer Science studies by delving into textbooks and online resources, but I’ve been quite lazy. Instead, I've been focusing on learning French, a language I've always wanted to master. I started learning French in elementary school, as it’s a requirement in Canada. While it might make more sense to learn my mother tongue, I’m opting to learn French, which might seem confusing to some. For context, I don't have an English name and was born in some Asian country but I am unable to communicate with others in my mother tongue.</p>
