description: A course review on multivariable Calculus course for Math honors students at CarletonU (fall half)
categories: [university, school, math, reviews, carletonu]
---

This is a course review of MATH2000 - Multivariable Calculus and Fundamentals of Analysis taken at CarletonU in 
the fall of 2023. The lectures were synchronous but with recorded lectures to accodomate those with COVID-19 or any other illness. 
This is a review of the first half of the course (the course is 8 months long, 1.0 credit).

**TLDR:**
* "introductory" to analysis is interesting but weird to get used to
* Similar to 1052 except extended and more generalized to "higher" dimensions
* Similar to 1052, covers limits, continuity, derivatives, and sequences with a small section on Taylor Polynomials from 2052
* learn how to paramaterize curves and surfaces

The review is split into 2 main parts:
1. [Long Course Description](#ldesc): In-depth talk about the course topic from how I understood it
2. [Course Review](#review): Solely focuses on the teaching style, difficulty, and anything that would be of interest

**Course Description (LONG) with Commentary:**  

Similarly to first year calculus (MATH1052, MATH2052), the lectures goes over a lot of proofs. Unlike MATH2100, another course students are required to take and usually taken concurrently, a good understanding of the proofs are not required. As long as you have the rough idea of how the proofs work is sufficient 
to do well in the course. MATH2000 is interesting in the sense that it extends what you know from first year calculus but "extended" to higher "dimensions". 
Starling does a good job to drill this into our heads that we are no longer working in one dimension but in higher dimensions. Even the name of the course 
suggests this (i.e. **Multi-variable** calculus). 

**First Year:** $f: \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$

**Second Year:** $f: \mathbb{R^n}\to\mathbb{R^m}$

As a soft introduction to working with functions of multiple variables, the course first began with talking about some properties of vectors. 
This topic should be familiar from Linear Algebra. A vector is a set of $n$ numbers belonging to $\mathbb{R^n} which is a set of n tuples of real numbers. 

$1\in\mathbb{R}$

$(1)\in\mathbb{R^1}$ (usually abbreviated as $(1)\in\mathbb{R}$

$(1, 2)\in\mathbb{R^2}$

Everything about vectors should be a review such as vector space properties, doct products and the norm of a vector. What is interesting but obvious is that 
the norm of a one-dimensional vector is the same as absolute value but in n-dimensional vector space, it is the euclidean distance.

$n = 1: \|\vec{x}\|= \sqrt{x^2} = \|x\|$ (absolute value)

$n = 2: \|\vec{x}\|= \|(x_1, x_2)\| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}$

What is not a review is the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality which is a neat inequality that can be used to explain why two vectors are orthogonal if their dot 
product is 0. The Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality is $\|\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y}\| \le \|\vec{x}\|\cdot \|\vec{y}\|$. The proof for the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality 
is not obvious at all and requires some "magical" function to proceed so I would not worry about understanding the proof for Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality at all. What is also interesting about the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality is that it presents another way to prove the triangle inequality that I suggest trying to 
understand because it can be helpful for assignments. For instance, $\|\vec{x}+\vec{y}|^2 = \sqrt{(\vec{x}+\vec{y})\cdot(\vec{x}+\vec{y})}^2 = (\vec{x}+\vec{y})\cdot(\vec{x}+\vec{y})$ is an expansion you 
should know for the assignments. One thing to note about the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality is to be able to differentiate what $\|\square\|$ means. As stated 
earlier, it could mean absolute value or it could mean the norm. It depends on what $\square$ is. In the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality, $\|\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y}|$ 
refers to the absolute value because the dot product operator $\cdot: \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ outputs a real number. While the 
other side of the inequality refers to the dot product between the two norms: $\|\vec{x}\|\cdot \|\vec{y}\|$. It may be obvious through context but it was 
something I thought would be important to highlight.

The reason why a Calculus course begins with talking about vectors is because we are dealing with functions of many variables. The input to our functions 
are no longer a single real number but a tuple of n real numbers. Even the output of the functions we'll be dealing with in the course may not even be 
a single real number but a vector such as a parameteric curves or some transformation.

The course then resembles a traditional calculus course where the definition of continuity is extended for a function $\vec{f}: \mathbb{R^n}\to\mathbb{R^m}$. 
Depending on your mathematical background, you might have learned a function is continuous at a point a if the limit from the left and the right are equal and the function is defined at the point a. Students with a stronger mathematical background or stronger mathematical interest would know that continuty can be 
defined using the delta-epsilon proofs that may have been exposed to in normal calculus but definitely to Math students in the honors/pure program. 
Luckily for us, the definition of continuty looks identical from first year with the exception of the domain and co-domain of the function.

> <b>First Year:</b> a function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $a\in\mathbb{R}$ if $\forall \epsilon > 0$ $\exists \delta > 0 $ such that 
$\forall x\in\mathbb{R}, \|a - x\| < \delta \implies \|f(a)-f(x)\|<\epsilon$

> <b>Second Year:</b> a function $\vec{f}:\mathbb{R^n}\to\mathbb{R^m}$ is continuous at $\vec{a}\in\mathbb{R^n}$ if $\forall \epsilon > 0$ $\exists \delta > 0 $ such that $\forall \vec{x}\in\mathbb{R^n}, \|\vec{a} - \vec{x}\| < \delta \implies \|\vec{f}(\vec{a})-\vec{f}(\vec{x})\|<\epsilon$

The course then begins to talk about open balls which is a neat concept I was introduced many years ago. As the name implies, it has something to do with 
open sets and a "ball" (which differs depending what n-dimension you are working with).

> <b>Open Ball Centered at $\vec{x}$</b>: for $r>0$ and $\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R^m}$, define the open ball $B_r(\vec{x})=\\{\vec{y}\in\mathbb{R}^m: \|\vec{x}-\vec{y}\| < r\\}$

The concept was first introduced to me in a course named Complex Variables (for non-pure math students that I never finished ... I was kicked out of the 
course years ago for not having the prerequisite knowledge). The concept of closed and open sets is very important in the course as we spend a lot of 
time (about a third of the course) on this topic. For starters, let's begin talking about what is a ball. A ball is some circular object in the vector space 
that contains a set of points. An open ball is the set of all points within the radius of the ball. This topic is where some students start to get lost. 
The concept of open balls is used to talk about a set such as the domain or co-domain in the course or to define what it means for a set to be open, closed, 
or to define if a point is an interior point or a boundary point. 

When talking about domain and co-domain in first-year, we talk about sets and introduce to some basic set notations. It turns out that an open ball in 
one dimension is simply an interval:

> <b>Open Ball Centered at $\vec{x}$ in one dimension</b>: for $r>0$ and $x\in\mathbb{R}$, define the open ball 
> $B_r(x)=\\{y\in\mathbb{R}: \|x-y\| < r\\} = (x-r, x+r)$

The reason why it's called an **open** ball is because the ball (set) does not contain points that are exactly r units away from the center of the ball. 
In case you didn't know, objects like a circle, sphere, or a ball have a boundary of radius r away from the center of the object. Meaning every point in 
the object is equidistant from the center and therefore any points in the boundary (outline) of the object is r units away from the center. One may say this 
is an obvious fact but to me personally, the fact the every boundary point on a circle or a sphere is equally far apart from the center as any other boundary 
point shocked me in university many years ago. This fact never registered in my brain despite being obvious. Anyhow, I digress (which is a reoccuring theme 
of my blogs). 

What makes open balls fascinating? There are a number of reasons but one of them is that we can rewrite the definition of continuity with open balls. 
For instance, here's the definition of continuity of a parameteric curve $\vec{f}\: I\to \mathbb{R}^n$ where $I\in\mathbb{R}$ is some interval (the domain 
of the function).

> A function $\vec{f}:I\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is continuous at $t\in\mathbb{R}$ if and only if $\forall \epsilon > 0$ $\exists \delta > 0$ such that $\forall s\in B_\delta (t)\cap I \implies  \vec{f}(s)\in B_\epsilon (\vec{f}(t))$

Open balls could be used to define many familiar concepts from 1052 such as bounded:

> <b>First Year:</b> a set S is bounded if $\exists M > 0$ such that $\|x\| < M \forall \vec{x}\in S$

> <b>Second Year:</b> $S \subseteq B_M(\vec{0})$ (i.e. there exists an open-ball of size M centered at 0 that contains S)

In between talking about open balls and set theory, the topic of parameterization is introduced such as the straight lines, circles, ellipses, and spirals. 
This topic was something that on the midterm that I thought would not be on it ... rip my grades ... Anyhow ...

The part that is confusing to students is not the definition of an open ball but when we use the definition of an open ball to describe if a point is an 
interior, closed, or a boundary point or to describe a neighborhood, closure or the set of boundary points.

> A point $\vec{x}$ in S is an <b>interior point</b> if $\exists r > 0$ such that $B_r(\vec{x})\subseteq S$ 

Let's disect what this cryptic definition. An interior point is a point inside a set that does not lie on the boundary. However, this is 
not a rigorous definition since we have not defined what does it mean to lie in the boundary. While I do not know if this topic lies in analysis or in 
topology, but this course gets much more in depth describing properties of sets. The cryptic definition is essentially stating that if $\vec{x}$ is an 
interior point, we can draw an extremely small open ball such that every point in the open ball lies inside the set S still as seen in the diagram below:

![A poor drawing of what it means to be an interior point](../assets/math-physics/handrawn-diagrams/math2000/interior-pt.jpg)

In the diagram, $x_o$ is an interior point since there exists an open ball $B_r(x_o)$, indicated in red, that is contained in the set S, marked in grey. The definition of an interior point can be utilized to describe what it means for a set to be open. One naturally thinks a set is open if there is no strictly defined endpoints in a set. For instance, `[0, 1]` is closed because there minimum and maxiumum in the interval/set is 0 and 1 respectively. But the set (0,1) is open because the minimum and maximum is not in the set/interval `(0,1)`. The definition of an open set used in the course is the following:

> $S \subseteq S^\circ$ is open $\iff \forall \vec{x}\in S$ $\exists r > 0$ such that $B_r(\vec{x})\subseteq S$

For context, $S^\circ$ means the set of all points in S that are interior points of S. So what points are discluded from $S^\circ$? It turns out any points that lie on the edge of the set (i.e. boundary points) do not belong to the set of interior points $S^\circ$. This brings us to the definition of boundary points:

> $\forall r > 0, B_r(\vec{x})\cap S\ne \emptyset \land B_r(\vec{x})\cap S^c \ne \emptyset$

![A poor drawing of what it means to be a boundary point](../assets/math-physics/handrawn-diagrams/math2000/boundary-pt.jpg)

In simpler terms, if a ball centered at some point can contain points **both** within the set S and it's complement (i.e. outside the set), then the point is a **boundary** point. This definition intuitively makes sense with an illustration. The fact that a ball can be drawn around the boundary points containing points inside and outside the set is what differentiates from interior points. Let's relate this new definition of open set with what we know about sets from Highschool. `[0, 1]` is a closed set where 0 and 1 are boundary points of the set.

**Review:** MATH2052 was less theoretical compared to MATH1052 but there was still way more emphasis on proofs and theory compared to my experience 
taking a regular calculus course years ago. Despite having prior calculus knowledge, I learned a lot from the course which is exactly what I wanted 
(or else why would I go back to University). I won't bore you with the details as I have already written some things I learned from the course in 
the long course description. This section of the course review will go through my thoughts on the course such as how the course was organized, and my 
thoughts on the lecture and tutorials.

To begin, the course could be taken fully asynchronous. Meaning that students could watch the prerecorded lectures whenever they wished to and also 
watch the recorded tutorials if students could not attend the tutorials for whatever reason. Additionally, the quizzes and tutorials could be taken 
anytime within a 24-hour window. The way the course was organized benefited me a lot because of changes in time schedule. I accepted a 4 month work contract 
for the winter semester so I had to drop all my courses that conflicted with my work schedule.

The course delivery was the same as how MATH1052 was organized. There were 3 quizzes in the course (each worth equally around 11%-12% of the 
final grade). The quizzes were 40 mins long and can be started anytime (but finished) within the 24-hour window. Students were required to not only write 
the quiz within 40 minutes but to also scan their solutions within the 40 minute time limit. Students are required to start the quiz 
at the latest, 40 mins before the 24-hour mark to take full advantage of the allotted time. The quizzes were not multiple choices and were typically 2-3 questions 
long. As the course is delivered online, all quizzes and including the exam were open book. My suggestion is to create cheat sheets so that you can quickly 
find a theorem or example if you have a memory of a goldfish like me. Open book quizzes and exams are both a blessing and a curse. I fear that 
I rely on my cheat sheet too much such that I may suffer a lot in the fall and winter term when the courses may not be delivered online (or if the course 
is not open-book). I feel like a computer with little working memory (i.e. RAM) so it needs to keep fetching data from the hard drive (i.e. cheat sheets). 
The key to open-book quizzes and exams is to be familiar with the content and what is on each cheat sheet so that you have a general understanding how 
to approach the problem, a lingering idea on how to start answering the question, and wherein your cheat sheet to look for. Essentially, you need to be 
familiar with the content such that without your cheat sheet, you would be able to answer the question if you were given an hour to tackle the problem 
(obviously that's way too slow for a quiz or exam).

I think the quizzes were fair in difficulty but could have been slightly harder (not saying I would like that though but it would be within reasonable bounds 
for them to do so). There were 5 assignments, each worth 6% to the final grade and these were not easy. I manage to finish all the quizzes within 1-2 days 
but it required me to concentrate extremely hard. There are a few problems (like 1-3 questions) in the assignments where I have absolutely no clue how I 
even came up with the solution (i.e. I understand the solution but I find it hard how I came to the answer if that makes any sense). The problem I have with 
the assignment which in extension is an issue with the timing of the tutorial is that the bulk of the content in the assignment cannot be answered without 
going to the tutorial first. But the tutorials were held on a Tuesday but the assignment was due 2 days after on a Thursday. Due to my day job (which finishes at 6pm), 
I am unable to work on the assignment on the day it's due. So I am limited to working on the assignment after I watched the recordings of the tutorial on a 
Tuesday night and Wednesday night after I finish dinner and my chores. The difficult part of planning the course is that the assignments and tutorials are based 
on the previous week's content so it's very hard to avoid this situation. Of course, I think the professor could have modified the contents of the quizzes and assignments 
around to give students at least a full week to work on the assignment. Though I suspect the professor assumes students were working on the assignments before the 
tutorials, I sure did not.

As for what the lectures were like, they were just prerecorded lectures released at the beginning of each week. This worked very well with my schedule as I could 
watch Monday's lectures ahead of time (i.e. on Monday) and then watch the recordings of the tutorial I always missed due to work on a Tuesday. The lectures 
were very clear and conveys the concept clearly. I have nothing to add other than Charles Starling does an excellent job and I would much rather listen to his 
lectures than reading the textbook. The textbook for the course is the same as MATH1052 which is Elementary Analysis by Kenneth A. Ross which is not a bad 
textbook but I personally don't like it either (i.e. neutral feelings about the textbook). The textbook is available online via the school library for free. I opted 
to buy the textbook since I like the feel of real paper but I probably would not have bought the textbook if MATH1052 and MATH2052 used different textbooks.

The exam is similar to the quizzes in the sense that there was a 24-hour window to complete the exam. Unlike the quiz, the exam may have been able to be started 
anytime within the 24-hour window and still be given the full 3 hours to write and scan the exam (though do check with your professor if for some reason MATH2052 was delivered 
online again because things could have changed and I may have understood how the exam worked). The exam was worth 30% of the final mark which is what every exam 
should be worth in my own opinion but I won't get into why. The exam was quite difficult and I did not do as well as I wanted to. Similarly to MATH1052, Charles Starling 
likes to add a bonus question to the exam for students to solve if they have time. Unfortunately, I did not even have the time to finish all the questions to my satisfaction. 
Hence why I did not do so well on the exam (didn't do bad either but could have been way better). I believe the exam average (if Brightspace wasn't lying to me) was 62.55% which 
made sense because the exam was quite difficult.
