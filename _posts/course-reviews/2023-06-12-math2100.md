title: MATH2100 -  Algebra [Fall + Winter]
description: A course review on abstract algebra course for Math honors students at CarletonU
categories: [university, school, math, reviews, carletonu]
---

This is a course review of MATH2100 - Algebra taken at CarletonU in 
the fall of 2022 and winter 2023. The lectures and tutorial were synchronous and in-person. Similarly to MATH2000, the course is split into 
two semesters covering different topics. The fall semester goes into a rabbit hole in the topic of Linear Algebra and the winter semester does an introduction 
to Group Theory and Rings.

**TLDR:**
* 

The review is split into 2 main parts:
1. [Long Course Description](#ldesc): In-depth talk about the course topic from how I understood it
* [Fall Term - Linear Algebra but in-depth](#ldesc-fall)
* [Winter Term - Introduction to Group Theory and Rings](#ldesc-winter)
2. [Course Review](#review): Solely focuses on the teaching style, difficulty, and anything that would be of interest

**Course Description (from website):** Introduction to group theory: permutation groups, Lagrange's theorem, normal subgroups, homomorphism theorems. Introduction to ring theory: ring of polynomials, integral domains, ideals, homomorphism theorems. Hermitian forms, spectral theorem for normal operators, bilinear and quadratic forms, classical groups.

**Course Description (LONG) with Commentary:**  

Similarly to first year calculus (MATH1052, MATH2052), the lectures goes over a lot of proofs. Unlike MATH2100, another course students are required to take and usually taken concurrently, a good understanding of the proofs are not required. As long as you have the rough idea of how the proofs work is sufficient 
to do well in the course. MATH2000 is interesting in the sense that it extends what you know from first year calculus but "extended" to higher "dimensions". 
Starling does a good job to drill this into our heads that we are no longer working in one dimension but in higher dimensions. Even the name of the course 
suggests this (i.e. **Multi-variable** calculus).
