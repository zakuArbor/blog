Although still under progress, I have been dabbling with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/), an HTML presentation framework. It's absolutely beautiful and has markdown and tex support which is excellent. I wanted to create a presentation that is more functional to showcase computer science concepts and found OpenOffice Impress to be unsuitable. After viewing the demo for reveal.js, I was immediately sold. It contains so many features that I need and has a low learning curve for someone who has sufficient HTML experience.

I've been writing a blog in preparation for an educational session I plan on holding for the team and the new interns on the various stages a compiler takes from taking a source code to an executable.
