PAM stands for Pluggable Authentication Module and its purpose from my understanding 
is to separate application developers from writing an authentication scheme into their 
program. Think of it as an authentication "API" for "privilege granting" applications but 
is flexible how each application authenticates the user. System administrators 
are given the control and decision to how each application authenticates a user by modifying 
PAM configs (policies) that could be found in locations such as `/etc/pam.d` (location may vary depending 
on the OS).

As stated in Linux PAM documentation, developers do not need to know how the authentication works. 
That is the beauty of PAM. But how do you know what applications are "PAM-Aware" (a term to refer 
to whether the application utilizes PAM for authentication)? According to [TechMint](https://www.tecmint.com/configure-pam-in-centos-ubuntu-linux/), 
one would just need to check whether or not a program is linked to `libpam.so` (the dynamic library for the PAM library). 
This would indeed be true for Linux, or at least that is how it should work nowdays.

To find a list of "PAM-aware" applications, you could check what PAM policies are packaged in your distribution under `/etc/pam.d`. However, 
the best method on Linux is to use `ldd` to see if the application dynamically links to the PAM library as stated previously. 

```
$ ldd `which su` | grep libpam
	libpam.so.0 => /lib64/libpam.so.0 (0x00007f4f305cf000)
	libpam_misc.so.0 => /lib64/libpam_misc.so.0 (0x00007f4f305c9000)
```

But are all "PAM-aware" applications dynamically linked to `libpam`?
There are various implementations of PAM such as Linux PAM and OpenPAM where the latter can be found in FreeBSD, macOS (as of Snow Leopard), 
and QNX. Although I could not find any documentation regarding the implementation of AIX's pam library, the documentation for AIX 7.3 (the 
latest version at the time of writing) states the following:

> The PAM library,/usr/lib/libpam.a, contains the PAM API that serves as a common interface to all PAM applications and also controls module loading. 
> [PAM library](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=modules-pam-library)

![An illustration of AIX 7.3 PAM overview](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ssw_aix_73/security/pam.jpg)

This would mean that the solution proposed will not apply to AIX as the PAM libraries are not dynamically linked to the applications 
(unless the `.a` extension means nothing to them). Unfortunately, I no longer have access to an AIX machine so I cannot confirm the details.
So how would one go about figuring out whether the application is "PAM aware" in this scenario? If you are lucky or an insider, you may be 
able to view the source code of the application in question to see if they include the PAM libraries (i.e. `#include <security/pam_appl.h>` in 
case of Linux PAM). The alternative and more feasible method is to check the binary itself if it includes the PAM symbols. This can be done 
using the `strings` utility or `nm` utility.

<pre class = "highlight"><font color="#D0CFCC"><b>$ </b></font>strings su | grep pam
<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>_open_session
<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>_close_session
<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>_set_item
<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>_setcred
<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>_start
<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>_strerror
<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>_acct_mgmt
<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>_getenvlist
<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>_chauthtok
<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>_end
<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>_authenticate
lib<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>.so.0
lib<font color="#C01C28"><b>pam</b></font>_misc.so.0
</pre>

However, if the symbols are stripped, you probably won't have much success with `nm`:
```
$ nm su
nm: su: no symbols
```

But if the binary was not stripped of its symbols, you could use `nm` to determine 
if the application is "PAM-aware" and whether the application is statically or dynamically 
linked by seeing if the symbols are undefined (i.e. if pam functions are undefined, then 
it's dynamically linked). Some UNIX-like OS and distributions do 
package the static library version of `libpam` along with the shared library. Whether it's 
being used or not is not something I know. But it would be application-dependent because 
some developers may still statically link their applications with `libpam.a`.

Before I conclude today's post, I want to comment on why `strings` utility still has PAM symbols even though the 
binary was stripped. `strings` utility is useful to see all the printable strings in a file. 
My assumption is that the pam functions cannot be stripped from the binary (i.e. such as the relocation section) to allow the dynamic 
linker to know what library and symbols it needs to link and bind to before executing the program. 
`strip` does have an option to strip the relocation data but the `man` pages caution this as it 
`may make the output file unusable`.

## Conclusion

On modern Linux systems, use `ldd` to see if `libpam.so` is be linked to the application. However, some distributions 
and other UNIX-like OS may allow statically linking to `libpam` so use `strings` if you suspect the application must 
be utilizing PAM.
