I recently found out accidentally at work that `vim` and `view` were the same thing when I happened to be editing a file on `view` instead of my beloved `vim` editor.
For context, `view` is often used in lieu of `vi` when trying to open a file for read only while retaining the same shortcuts as `vi`. This is why it surprised me 
to see that I could modify a file when `view` was supposed to be read only. If we were to take a look at the documentation:

```
$ man -Leng view
VIM(1)                                                                  General Commands Manual                                                                  VIM(1)

NAME
       vim - Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor

SYNOPSIS
       vim [options] [file ..]
       vim [options] -
       vim [options] -t tag
       vim [options] -q [errorfile]

       ex gex
       view
       gvim gview vimx evim eview
       rvim rview rgvim rgview
```

Interestingly, the man pages for `view` points to `vim` and we can see all sorts of different types of editors listed along with it such as `gvim`.
[AIX 7.3 documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=v-view-command) states that `view` `Starts the vi editor in read-only mode.` This is indeed 
evident when I take a look at how view is defined in my system (Fedora 41):
```bash
$ cat /usr/bin/view
#!/usr/bin/sh

# run vim -R if available
if test -f /usr/bin/vim
then
  exec /usr/bin/vim -R "$@"
fi

# run vi otherwise
exec /usr/libexec/vi -R "$@"
```

where `-R` is a flag for `Read-only mode`:
```
       -R          Read-only  mode.  The 'readonly' option will be set.  You can still edit the buffer, but will be prevented from accidentally overwriting a file.  If
                   you do want to overwrite a file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command, as in ":w!".  The -R option also implies the -n option (see above).  The
                   'readonly' option can be reset with ":set noro".  See ":help 'readonly'".
```

## Vim Oddities

What I found particularly odd was how at work, on one system `view` was simply a symlink to `vi`

```
$ realpath view
/usr/bin/vi
```

while on another machine, the two had the same md5sum (the md5sum is for illustration purposes, I just replicated the behavior on my local machine):
```
zaku@fedora:/usr/bin$ md5sum view
8fe562f5dd43b70c38f10ee2ec3310ca  view
zaku@fedora:/usr/bin$ md5sum vim
8fe562f5dd43b70c38f10ee2ec3310ca  vim
```

This odd behavior made me confused so I decided to make an experiment seeing how the only difference between `view` and `vim` on both systems at work was their names:

<div class = "highlighter-rouge"><div class = "highlight"><pre class = "highlight"><code>$ ln -s /usr/bin/vim view-pika
$ ls -l view-pika
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 zaku zaku 12 22 janv. 22:52 <font color="#2AA198"><b>view-pika</b></font> -&gt; <font color="#859900"><b>/usr/bin/vim</b></font>
</code></pre></div></div>

And it **BEHAVED THE SAME** as `view`. Thus I concluded, `vim` behaves differently depending on the name of the command being executed. More precisely, if the program 
started with the name `view` then it would open `vim` as read-only by taking a look at `argv[0]`. Upon looking at the source code on [Github](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/src/main.c#L1954)
under `main.c::parse_command_name()`:
```c
    if (STRNICMP(initstr, "view", 4) == 0)
```

where `initstr = gettail((char_u *)parmp->argv[0]);` as suspected. This explains why `pika-view` did not work but `view-pika` worked. It only compared the first 
4 characters of `argv[0]` to see if it starts with `view`. If you inspect the code more, you'll see that `vim` has many faces.

This behavior is entirely documented on the man pages which I never noticed:
```
Vim behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the executable may still be the same file).

       vim       The "normal" way, everything is default.

       ex        Start in Ex mode.  Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.  Can also be done with the "-e" argument.

       view      Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from writing the files.  Can also be done with the "-R" argument.

       gvim gview
                 The GUI version.  Starts a new window.

       gex       Starts a new gvim window in Ex mode. Can also be done with the "-e" argument to gvim

       vimx      Starts gvim in "Vi" mode similar to "vim", but with additional features like xterm clipboard support

       evim eview
                 The GUI version in easy mode.  Starts a new window.  Can also be done with the "-y" argument.

       rvim rview rgvim rgview
                 Like the above, but with restrictions.  It will not be possible to start shell commands, or suspend Vim.  Can also be done with the "-Z" argument.
```

### Extra Random Information on VIM and VI

1.) Viewing Compilation Flags

That was all I wanted to look at in regards to `view` and `vim`. One interesting timbit about `vim` is that you can see what it appears to be the compilation flag by running: `vim --version`:
```
         fichier vimrc système : "/etc/vimrc"
     fichier vimrc utilisateur : "$HOME/.vimrc"
  2e fichier vimrc utilisateur : "~/.vim/vimrc"
  3e fichier vimrc utilisateur : "~/.config/vim/vimrc"
      fichier exrc utilisateur : "$HOME/.exrc"
 fichier de valeurs par défaut : "$VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim"
               $VIM par défaut : "/usr/share/vim"

```

2.) One unique thing about `vim` is a charityware. If you simply type in `vim`, the menu will ask you to help children in Uganda through ICCF Holland.

![vim menu telling users to support children in Uganda](../assets/programming/vim-fr.png)

3.) [Vimconf](https://vimconf.org/) is held in Japan. This indicates that `vim` either has a strong presence in Japan or a very dedicated fanbase.

4.) Ubuntu 24.04 ships `vim.tiny`, likely a more stripped down version of `vim` 

5.) `vi` packaged on a QNX virtual target is called [`elvis`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_(text_editor)), an enhanced clone of `vi`. QNX probably ships `elvis` 
as the default editor due to its small size compared to `vim` (though this also means less features compared to `vim`). The QNX Raspberry Pi 4 image though ships with 
regular `vim`.
