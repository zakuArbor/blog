title: QNX - An Introduction to Adapative Partitioning Scheduler and How to Bankrupt Partitions
description: A look into QNX APS feature
categories: [programming, c/c++, aps, qnx]
---

In preparation to my presentation on QNX APS (Adaptive Partitioning Scheduler), I decided to write 
a blog that goes through what partitions are, how to control resources in QNX, and what APS are. 
Though a lot of the information is just based on the QNX documentation all put into one page but 
with examples and referencing other publically available resources (i.e. foundary27, papers, blogs, and 
what I found from playing around with APS). This page will not go through how to use APS through the 
Momentics IDE nor will it cover the various C API's to configure the partition. There's already a lot 
to cover, so the C API's will be covered in another blog post (provided I can muster enough willpower 
to finish my research and code examples before my 30-day QNX trial license expires i.e. the University 
rejected my application for a QNX license and QNX has not gotten back to me about my request for an 
education license - though I think there was a glitch since the website was behaving weirdly when 
I request it so they may not have received my request).

## Constraining A Single Process
---

As resources are limited, there is a need for a way to control how much resources a process can consume. 
Traditionally, sysadmin would set limits to users and processes. This is probably noticeable on lab machines in universities, 
machines that are shared among many students to prevent any malicious user or process from denying resources to others. This 
can be done using `ulimit`, a utility to view or set limits to a particular process.

For instance, here's the resource limit of my account on my personal Linux machine.
```
$ ulimit -Sa
real-time non-blocking time  (microseconds, -R) unlimited
core file size              (blocks, -c) unlimited
data seg size               (kbytes, -d) unlimited
scheduling priority                 (-e) 0
file size                   (blocks, -f) unlimited
pending signals                     (-i) 62398
max locked memory           (kbytes, -l) 8192
max memory size             (kbytes, -m) unlimited
open files                          (-n) 1024
pipe size                (512 bytes, -p) 8
POSIX message queues         (bytes, -q) 819200
real-time priority                  (-r) 0
stack size                  (kbytes, -s) 8192
cpu time                   (seconds, -t) unlimited
max user processes                  (-u) 62398
virtual memory              (kbytes, -v) unlimited
file locks                          (-x) unlimited
```

If I was to share the machine with another user, I would for instance limit the 
number of files and processes that can be opened and spawned to avoid them 
from fork bombing my machine.

There are POSIX Calls such as `getrlimit` and `setrlimit` to display or set resource 
consumption. There are other function calls (non-POSIX) such as `prlimit` to set and 
view resource consumption on both QNX and Linux. In fact, `rlimit` function calls are 
just wrappers to `prlimit()` according to the documentation ([QNX](http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/7.1/index.html#com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/s/setrlimit.html) and [Linux](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prlimit.2.html)).

## Constraining A Group of Processes
---

However, `rlimit` resource restriction only applies to each applications. It is not flexible and is unable 
to restrict processes as a collective group. That is where 
cgroups and partitions come to play. `cgroups` (Control Groups) is a feature on the Linux kernel 
that allows admins to allocate resources to a group/partition of tasks and are much more complex 
compared to what QNX offers where only the CPU resources can be controlled. As this is an article 
about QNX and not Linux, I will not go into subsystems and how that explains why separate hierarchies of cgroups 
are necessary. You can read [Redhat's documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/sec-relationships_between_subsystems_hierarchies_control_groups_and_tasks) 
if you are interested (I also don't know much about it anyways).
 
On QNX, the term partition is used to describe the controlled use of processor 
resources (i.e. processing time) that is isolated from other partitions ([Glossary](http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/7.1/index.html#com.qnx.doc.neutrino.sys_arch/topic/glossary.html)). 
Essentially you can divide CPU processing time in virtual objects called partitions where processes can be executed in and be guaranteed to have the CPU time specified in their configuration.

![An image of 3 partitions being allocated 50%, 20% and 30% of resources respectively](http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/7.1/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.sys_arch/images/static_partitions.png)
<p class = "caption">An excerpt from QNX Documentation</p>


As stated earlier, the ability to constrain resources into partitions is to avoid any "single point of failure" whereby a malicious process consumes the entire system resource and starves all other threads 
(i.e. fork bombs or a DDOS attack). Partitions 
allows processes in other partitions to receive their allocated share of system resources. This is very crucial especially for projects that require high availability and reliability (there's a difference 
between the two terms but I won't get into it). Another great use case for APS is the abvility to recover from a locked system. To illustrate, you can designate 10% of the CPU to a shell so that whenever 
disaster strikes, you will still have access to the shell to perform any data recovery, cleanup, and freeing the system from the malicious process/thread. 

However, what happens to the remaining CPU time for partitions that don't utilize their entire allocated CPU time (referred as CPU budget or time budget) such as in the case where you allocate 10% of the 
CPU to a recovery shell? The recovery shell isn't going to be needed so it would be a waste for the CPU to not be used.
That is where the term "adaptive" comes into the chat. Static partitions cannot share resources and unable to adapt at runtime but adaptive partitions can. QNX offers the ability for partitions to share 
their left over budget to other partitions to utilize and can be configured at runtime if you decide the current configuration is not desirable.

## APS - Adapative Partitioning Scheduler 
---

<details class = "note-body">
<summary class = "note">Initial Setup</summary>
To utilize APS, you need to ensure that the APS module is loaded into the image. This requires changing your 
buildfile to include <code class = "highlight">[module=aps]</code> at the beginning of the line where you start `procnto-smp-instr`. You can find more details in 
the <a href = "http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/7.1/index.html#com.qnx.doc.adaptivepartitioning.userguide/topic/quickstart_Base_.html">Quickstart: Adaptive Partitioning Thread Scheduler</a> on the QNX documentation.
Run <code class = "highlight">aps show</code> to see if APS is running on the system.

<b>Example:</b> APS not running on the system
<code class = "highlight">
# aps show

</code>

<u><b>Partition of a Child Process:</b></u>
<br/>

When the system boots up, a partition `System` is automatically created for you. Any process you start from the shell will be assigned to the `System` partition (assuming you have not 
played around with APS on the image buildfile) because by default, child processes/threads belong to the parent's partition by default.

```

```

<br/>
<u><b>Create a Partition:</b></u>
<br/>

A partition has a few attributes you can set during creation but the only argument required is the CPU budget allocated 
to the partition. All other parameters are optional and will be explained later.

```
aps create [-B critical_budget] -b budget [-m max_budget] [-P critical_priority] [partition_name] 
```

Each partitions are allocated a percentage of the CPU over some average time window (explained later).
For instance, if we want to create a partition with a budget of 9.8% (i.e.  up to one decimal are accepted), you would run the following command:
```
# aps create -b 9.8
```

**Output:**
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre class = "highlight">
<code># aps
                    +-------- CPU Time --------+-- Critical Time --

</pre>
</div>

The partition name **1** is not a very meaningful name so ensure you assign a meaningful name to the partition during creation 
or else the partition id will be the name. For obvious reasons, partition's cannot start with a number (i.e. cannot tell apart from id if that was allowed).

### APS In Action
---

Enough babbling, let's see APS in action. Let's create 2 partitions: **drivers** and **recovery** where each partition is allocated a budget of 40% and 5% each respectively:
```
aps create -b 40 drivers 
aps create -b 5 recovery
```

**Output:**

--------------------+------------------------+---------------------
Total               | 100.0% |        |  0.09% |</code></pre></div>

To start and execute a process onto each partition, we'll be using the `on` command:
```
on -Xaps=recovery ksh 
on -Xaps=drivers ./gpu-nv &
```

**Output:**

<b>on</b> is a utility to execute a command. It's a useful utility to start a process on another remote node, with a CPU affinity, with a priority, or as a different user.
In our case, we are using <b>on</b> because it's a simple way to start a process on a partition.

As you can observe, we have a faulty graphics driver eating up a lot of the CPU. Notice how it is consuming more than the allocated budget the **drivers** partition has been allocated for. This is due to the fact that 
partitions can share their allotted CPU time to other partitions during a **freetime**.

Let's see what happens when we execute a very computational heavy process which we will call **simulate** on the default partition **System**:

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">

As you can see, **System** partition and the **drivers** partition consume roughly half of the computation each, consuming the freely leftover CPU resources from the **Recovery** Partition.
Although the **System** and **drivers** partition are consuming roughly all of the CPU, we still have control over the shell still. This is because I am running on the shell from the **recovery** 
partition. 

<details class = "note-body">
<summary class = "note">Emergency Shell</summary>
The example I am showing you isn't a realistic approach to recover control of your system. Realistically you would start <b>io-pkt</b> on a partition and <b>qconn</b> as well if you are on a development target (i.e. <b>qconn</b> should not 
and shall not be deployed on a production system) to ensure you have access to the system without compromising on performance (since unused resources are distributed to other partitions).

<br/> 

Since our shell is on the **Recovery** partition, we still can interact with the system despite the system running on full capacity. But what happens if we were to strip the **recovery** partition all of its CPU budget? 
The answer is that we lose all control of the system and will require to reboot the system. This can be achieved by using the **modify** command in the **aps** utility: `aps modify -b 0 recovery`

## Add and Check Processes's Partitions

---

In our previous example, we used **on** utility to start processes on different partitions. But what if you want to add running threads to different partitions? That is where the **join** command in the **aps** utility comes in handy.
Let's say we have a process named **foo** running on the **System** partition but we wish to have it run on the **drivers** partition. We could do the following to migrate the process to execute on the **drivers** partition:
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">                              
<pre class = "highlight">                                                       
<code># pidin -F "%N %I %H" -p foo # we need to know the thread and pid of the thread we wish to migrate     
name               pid-tid     ExtSched            
<b>./foo                614402-01 System</b>
# aps join -p <b>614402</b> -t <b>1 drivers</b>
# pidin -F "%N %I %H" -p foo       
name               pid-tid     ExtSched            
./foo                614402-01 <b>drivers</b></code></pre></div>

If you simply want to see what partitions each process in your system is running on, you can simply run `pidin sched`. 
I just used a more compilicated option because I needed both the pid and tid to migrate the thread to another partition.

## Scheduling Behavior During Different Loads

---

Before I get into the technical details how the scheduler works, let's look at what the scheduling behavior under different loads are like. For now we'll only consider 
the following scenarios (we'll be omitting details about by critical threads and the behavior of the scheduler in **freetime-by-ratio** mode for this section):

1. Underload
2. Partition A using over their budget but there's still **free time**
3. Full Load

<a name = "loads-underload"/>
<br/>
<b><u>1. Partition using less than it's budget</u></b>
<br/>

When partitions do not consume over it's assigned budget is called an **underload**. Since it's not overloaded, a strict realtime scheduler is applied where the highest priority threads gets to be executed.

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">

<p class = "caption"><b>Example of an underload</b></p>

<a name = "freetime"/>                                                   
<br/>                                                                           
<b><u>2. Partition A using over their budget</u></b>                          
<br/>   

Freetime occurs when a partition has no READY threads so it lends its CPU time to other partitions that have READY threads. 
Similarly to the previous case, the scheduler will choose the highest READY priority thread to run because the CPU time will be distributed to other partitions since there are **"freetime"** from one of the partitions. 
What if all the remaining partitions have the same highest priority? Who gets more of the share of the idling CPU time (i.e. freetime) from the sleeping partition? The scheduler will divide the freetime between the remaining partitions 
based on the proportions of their allocated (i.e. normal) budget.

In the sample output below, we have two partitions: Alice and Bob where Bob has two threads with a priority of 20 and Alice has two threads with a lower priority of 10 and the System partition (default partition) isn't using much of 
its budget so their budget so the CPU time is distributed to other partitions. Notice how threads under Alice gets the minimum 
budget but Bob having higher priority threads consumes way over its assigned budget (like the greedy person he is) despite having a smaller budget than Alice.

A **Full Load** is when all partitions need their entire budget. The default scheduling behavior is 
to divide the time between the threads in the partition based on the ratio of their budgets. However, 
there is no guarantee each partition will get billed its share of the CPU because we still need to guarantee 
real time performance (will be looked at later).

I have been hinting about critical threads a few times and you've been seeing an entire 
section of the output in `APS` reserved for Critical Time. So you may be asking what is it?

QNX is a realtime OS meaning that it needs to be able start and complete its task 
on time with the most minimal amount of delay. This is where critical threads come into play. 
A Critical thread is a thread that have "strict realtime requirements" meaning they can be 
pre-empted to ensure realtime performance.

To achieve this realtime requirements, critical threads by design are allowed to go over 
the normal budget of a partition provided the partition has a **critical budget**. 

For a partition to go over its budget during a fully loaded system, a critical budget greater than 0ms must be assigned 
to the partition. A **critical budget** is the number of milliseconds that the critical thread in a partition can consume during 
the average time window if the partition has exhausted its **normal budget** ([QNX - Critical Threads](http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/7.1/index.html#com.qnx.doc.adaptivepartitioning.userguide/topic/aps_details_Critical_threads_.html)). 
Since critical threads are pre-empted, other partitions will not meet its budget (i.e. will not consume their allotted CPU time).

A thread is considered critical in a partition if the thread's priority is at or greater than the 
critical priority set during the creation of the partition (though you can use `aps modify -P` if you forgot). 
If the system is not currently overloaded, then the critical budget will not be billed because there's available CPU resources it can take from. 
A critical budget is billed only if the running partition ran out of budget (provided the partition had a non-zero critical budget) and is competing with at least one other partition for CPU time.
This means that if there is freetime or the partition has remaining normal budget left, the scheduler will not bill the critical thread for running.
What happens if a partition exceeds its critical budget? A bankruptcy will occur which will be the next topic.


**Side Note:** If a critical thread is killed, the system crashes ([QNX - on utility with -c options](http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/7.1/index.html#com.qnx.doc.neutrino.utilities/topic/o/on.html)). 
Though I am not seeing a connection between APS critical threads and critical threads set by the `on` utility but I will need to investigate more on this.

## Bankruptcy

What happens when a company runs out of money? It goes bankrupt. 
Similarly, if a partition is billed for the critical CPU time that exceeds its critical budget, the partition will become bankrupt. 
There are three ways to handle bankruptcy:
1. **Basic (default):** deliver bankruptcy notification events and make the partition out of budget for the rest of the scheduling window
* notify of bankruptcy to the system
* cannot run till it receives more funding (i.e. budget)
    * at minimum needs to wait the number of milliseconds the critical budget was set to before it can run again
2. **Cancel:** Set partition's critical budget to 0ms meaning it cannot use its critical budget
    * need to restore critical budget if you want to use critical CPU time (i.e. `aps modify -B` or `SCHED_APS_MODIFY_PARTITION` command to the `SchedCtl()`)
3. **Reboot:** system crash with offending partition (should be used for testing purposes only)

Similarly to how poor business decisions can lead companies to bankruptcy, if a bankruptcy occurs, it is considered the design error of the application.

* by default child processes/threads go into parent's partition by default
* scheduling works as normal (highest priority thread gets the CPU time)

 You can use adaptive partitioning to make it easier to debug an embedded system by providing emergency access to it:

    during development — create a partition and start io-pkt and qconn in it. Then, if a runaway process ties up the system, you can use the IDE to debug and query the system.
    during deployment — create a partition and start io-pkt and inetd in it. If you encounter a problem, you can telnet into the system.

In either case, if you don't need to use this partition, the thread scheduler allocates its budget among the other partitions. This provides you with emergency access to the system without compromising performance. 
```
Partition budgets are enforced only when the CPU is running to capacity. All available cycles are used if they are needed, but when processes in more than one partition compete for cycles, the partitioning enforces resource budgets and prevents resource starvation.
