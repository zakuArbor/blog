In order to complete my goals to read [30 books in 2021](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/26641939) and complete my 
[2021 Reading List](../books-i-read-2021), here's a list of books I plan to 
finish in this session (not including books for studying Math & Science) or take a look at:
* [Algorithmic Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52555533-algorithmic-thinking%22)

* [How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43852758-how-to)
    * 5 Chapters a Week (i.e. 1 chapter per weekday)

**Resume & Finish 1 of 3 Books:**

# Physics

---

I will solely be focusing on Classical Mechanics and not Electromagnetism. I'll be prepping for Electromangnetism in the Winter Break.

**References Used:**

* [No bullshit guide to math and physics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22876442-no-bullshit-guide-to-math-and-physics?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=UoU0x3UGEn&rank=1)

<a id = "calc"/>

# Calculus

---

I'll only be covering Calculus 1 where limits, continuty, derivatives, and antiderivatives are covered. I may review Integration but it would be more useful 
to review Mathematical Proofs than integrals because most of my courses will be focusing or incorprating proofs into the course. I can always review 
integrals in the winter break.
