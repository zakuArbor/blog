title: Summer Plans Now that I am Unemployed (I resigned)

Now that I am unemployed and waiting for school to start in September, I have a 
few weeks for myself to prepare for my freshman studies in Math and Physics. I could 
have worked till September and resign when school starts, but I wanted to make the 
most of my studies by reviewing the fundamentals.

For context, I do not have a strong background nor knowledge in the Sciences and 
Math. I completely forgot everything I learned in Highschool Chemistry and my 
knowledge in Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Physics in the University level are
rusty. I do recognize I have an advantage over my peers in Calculus, Linear 
Algebra, and Physics having done some form of it at the University level before, 
it does not change the fact that I still have a lot to learn and it does not 
hurt to review the contents. The level of Math and Physics is not on the same 
difficulty as the courses I am to take in the Fall because it does not cover 
analysis and it was for Math majors rather than for the honors program. 
Therefore, I will learn a lot from my courses in the upcoming fall semester.

The main challenge is being self-motivated to make the most of the time I have 
before school starts to review. From experience, I have repeatedly failed 
my goals whether it be self improvement, work-related, study-related, and even 
goals to play videogames. My motivation to improve or do anything productive 
has always been low but even more so after the pandemic hit. I sleep late, 
stay on my computer doing nothing productive, and laze around. I want to 
take the next few weeks to change my habits. I wonder if I'll succeed or fail 
like the typical person who fails to continue their New Years Resolution.

The purpose of this post is to see how much I can improve myself in the next 
few weeks. I will be updating another [post](../summer-2021-checklist) on a 
weekly basis to see how much progress I am making on my studies and self 
improvement in the following weeks. I doubt these posts will be of any interest 
to anyone and can be self-incriminating to post about your possible failures 
online, I think this tatic can be a form of reason to push yourself.

I won't go into the details of my checklist but here's a general breakdown:
* Chemistry Review
* Physics Review
* Calculus Review
* Linear Algebra Review
* Computer Science & Programming Learning
* Book Reading
* Blog Book Review
* Developing Good Habits

As you can see there's quite a bit on my list but I will try to be somewhat 
realistic on my goals. I did put my career on hold and using my life savings 
to pursue another path with no plans in mind. So I do want to make the most 
of my time improving myself and increase my chances to do well in my studies.

At the end of my 3 weeks of studying, I will release a reflection on the same 
[checklist post](../summer-2021-checklist) that will serve both a "living" 
document of my progress and small notes to myself of what I need to work on.
