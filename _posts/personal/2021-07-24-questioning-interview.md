title: Question to Ask In An Interview
categories: [interview, career]
---

I have been pondering lately on how to respond when the interviewer asks if you have any questions for them. After much pondering, here are the list 
of questions I would ask (subject to change):

1. Describe to me an overview of your day at work and the technologies you employ.
* There are times when the job description does not encapsulate the position you are applying for. I know many students who feel dejected after their first 
month of their job. The job description are generic and can be absolutely deceitful. I have seen students applying and receiving job positions for full stack 
developer or backend developer to only work in devOps or in testing. It's absolutely crucial to know what to expect in the job. Do not assume what the job is.
I have been lucky to have an interviewer giving me an overview of the various teams I may join and what they do. Contrary to what the job posting states, the 
actual positions and tasks did not match what was advertised.
* Having knowledge on the day to day job for the position you are applying for gives you an insight what your day to day work is going to be like. This can 
help you spot red flags though it is very possible the interviewer will sugar coat the job which I have seen many times.
* knowing what technologies they employ can give you a rough idea what skills you need to brush up on. Even if you do not receive a job offer, it's great to 
know what and how other companies are tacking a particular issue, what technologies they employ, and what skills the industry are looking for.

2. What are the painpoints your team are having?
* This shows your interest to solve problems the team are facing. In addition, it also informs you what to expect on the job.
* If you have multiple interviews with various companies on the same position, you can see if painpoints are shared within the industry.

3. What are you excited about in the field?
* you get perspective of what to invest your time in and the opportunities that lie within the field

4. What are common issues you see among applicants?
* this is a perfect way to see what red flags to avoid. If you committed these red flags, you now know to not repeat the same mistake and improve your chances 
to get a position for next time

5. What are some skills or traits do you wish more applicants have
* the answers will give you areas where you can improve to succeed in your job hunt

This is not a complete list of questions you should ask in your next interview. There are other questions that may be of interest to you such as the 
compensation package and the work hour expectations. But I want to focus on thinking of questions that invoke a learning experience. Something that you 
can take away from the interview even if you do not get the position.
