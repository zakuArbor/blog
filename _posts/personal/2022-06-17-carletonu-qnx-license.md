**tldr:** licenses will only be distributed for the use in the classroom or faculty-led research

As I got no research done on anything technical, I thought for this month I would go over CarletonU's QNX 
license request policy for those who are studying at CarletonU. As some may know, Blackberry QNX in 2021 started 
some research initiative that gives CarletonU access to multi-year QNX licenses for education. The Research 
Computing Services (RCS) at CarletonU is responsible for distributing the licenses to classes and to researchers alike. 
Being a student at CarletonU, I was curious if I could obtain a QNX license myself to fiddle around and write 
blog posts on various features in QNX such as message pulses, devctl/ioctl, and QNX utilities such as dumpifs. 
However, after contacting RCS who were taken by surprise as my request was not within their defined 
use case, they replied that they 
"decided to licenses will only be distributed for the use in the classroom or faculty-led research" after 
discussing among themselves. So no free licenses are available for curious students unfortunately.

p.s. If you were expecting a more technical blog post, I would like to apologize as I probably won't be able 
to finish one this month. The topic I wanted to cover was a comparison of the derivation of the double angle formula 
through linear algebra and one that is more geometric.
