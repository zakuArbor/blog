# INTRODUCTION
Now that I am finished with University (unless somehow I fail my electives), I thought I would briefly review all the Computer Science (CS) courses I have taken at the University of Toronto (Mississauga and St. George campus). I have taken 11.5 credits (23 CS courses), I thought it would be nice to reflect on my experiences with them on a sunny Canada Day. Hopefully, this would be of some use to others but please do take note this is my bias experience.

Before I start talking about the various courses I took, there may be some bias reviews with courses taught by my favorite professors: Larry Yulei Zhang, Vincent Maccio, Arnold Rosenbloom, Ilir Dema, and Simon Bogdan and perhaps also Furkan Alaca (it’s unfortunate I was not able to take a regular course with him so I cannot judge his teaching. I have a feeling he would have been one of my favorites if I had taken a regular course with him). Spoilers: I never had a terrible professor. Anyways, this is not only a review of courses I took but will also include a reflection on my progress in University along with some personal side stories.

# FIRST YEAR – 2 COURSES
First year computer science courses are not difficult at all. If you are new to programming, then you will need to invest more time than those who already know programming beforehand. Programming can be weird at first but you just need practice. I have helped a lot of students in CSC108 and CSC148 and I notice that a lot of students don’t think like a computer scientist. You need to be able to understand what the problem is, how to break it down, and be familiar with concepts taught in class. This does not simply come from just reading lecture notes but to get your hands dirty and make a bunch of small programs. Make a lot of simple programs that are less than 50 lines of codes to get a hang on with Python and how to think like a computer scientist.

A lot of students are lost on how to start and often tell me they don’t know where to start on their assignment or that those little projects are stupid and meaningless. You need to start somewhere and starting simple is probably the best idea. When I first tried to learn programming a long time ago, I made very simple programs that would just take in inputs from the user and add them together, a random number guessing game, or just simply spamming different functions with different inputs to see how they would behave. It may seem stupid to others but it’s quite fascinating in my own opinion. To be able to tell the computer what to do and theorize how programs work was interesting.

First-year is probably going to be stressful and competitive because of POST requirements where you need to do very well in first-year to get into Computer Science POST unlike other Universities such as uOttawa, CarletonU, Ryerson, and YorkU where you are admitted directly to the Computer Science program after High School. UTM does things differently by evaluating your high school marks to enter the University but not to the program itself. To enter into the Computer Science program, they evaluate your performance in first-year. Nowadays, you will probably be competing to be the top 250 students or so out of 1000 or more first-year students who also wish to study Computer Science at the University.

## CSC108: INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING 1
### CSC108: Introduction to Programming 1
**Professor:** Ilir Dema

**Coordinator:** Arnold Rosenbloom

**Description:** In this course, you will go through the basics of programming using Python such as string and list manipulation, control statements (if, while loop, for loop, switch statements), big O notation, and functions. Unit tests are also taught and you are required to write some for any assignments assigned to you.

**TLDR:**
* Beginner friendly, no previous experience needed
* Difficulty varies depending on your level of experience but overall it's not hard for those with no background if you practice
* Practice Practice Practice, especially if you are new to programming
* take advantage of your TA and office hours. Ask for help if you are stuck

**Review:** Ilir Dema is a very nice and intelligent professor. I absolutely loved his lecture which I recall very well being on Monday from 6pm-9pm. The course assignments are very straight forward and the course overall is not difficult at all. However, if you are new to programming and lack how to break down problems, this course will be quite difficult for you at the start. It's normal to struggle in the beginning if you are new to programming. This course equips you with the fundamentals that all programmers need to know. When I took it, the coordinator was trying to force all of us to use a virtual machine but that wasn't necessary at all. You can use whatever Operating System you wish and whatever IDE you prefer including vim.

The assignments were well thought and were designed to be fun, especially the last assignment where we had to make a text-based adventure game. This allowed us to use our creativity and work in pairs. I mostly did the assignment myself but it helps to have a partner to discuss your code and ideas with. This is important to have experience with since you will be working with pairs or in groups a lot in future courses and the workplace as well. Almost all programming assignments in Computer Science have starter code so you will need to get used to reading the starter code before you start the assignment to understand what functions you need to work with.

Labs are an essential part of your learning in computer science. Attend your labs and feel free to ask questions. Just don't ask for the answer, be specific. Look over the lab tasks before you head to the lab (perhaps start working on them beforehand so you know what questions to ask and be able to complete your lab by the due date).

Feel free to ask questions with your TAs, professors, and classmates. Interacting with others and working on problems together helps you learn. However, you must not commit academic plagiarism. CSC108 along with CSC148 is plagued with students copying each other. There's nothing wrong with asking for help and discussing possible approaches to solving a problem but you must write the code yourself and be able to derive the solution when asked by your professor and TA.

## CSC148: Introduction to Programming 2
**Professor:** Tiffany Tong

**Coordinator:** Dan Zingaro

**Description:** A follow up to CSC108 where you learn about Object Oriented Programming and some basic data structures such as Binary Trees, Stacks, Queues, and Linked List.

**TLDR:**
* A lot more work and covers much harder concepts than CSC108
* Assignments will take much longer to complete compared to CSC108
* Spend time reading the starter code, assignment handout, and what others are asking in the discussion board


**Review:** CSC148 is definitely harder than CSC108 but it is not a difficult course either. Put in the time to learn the concepts from class and try to implement them yourself. Practice leads to perfection. Programming is simply just practice. You cannot be good at programming without practice. Be very familiar with the principles of Object-Oriented Programming and the data structures taught in class. These are essential for any programmer who wants to be a software developer. The tests are what you would expect, just different variations of concepts you have learned in class such as writing some data structure that behaves a bit differently compared to those taught in class. I cannot remember exactly what was on those tests but I didn't find them hard at all.

Although I said those tests were not hard, I didn't do well in this course. I was overconfident because I found the assignments and tests easy that I did not study for the exam and often assumed I knew what the questions were asking without reading the questions at all by quickly glancing at the behaviors and the provided code. I ended up dropping probably around 20% from the exam because I didn't answer the questions the way they wanted it such as using recursion instead of loops, and etc (you'll get a 0 if you answer something using loops and not recursion if the question asks you to answer it using recursion).

Assignments were quite interesting and can be a bit time-consuming. The hardest part of the assignments I found was reading the assignment handout and trying to understand what the professor is asking for. Once you read the discussion board and read over the handout a few times and look at the starter code, it's not bad. The last assignment I had in CSC148 was very interesting and fun. This was somewhat of a challenge for me and took me a few days to finish it. The assignment consisted of a few puzzles (grid peg solitaire, word puzzle, sudoku and etc) where you had to write an algorithm that would solve all of them under a time limit. The search algorithm involved was BFS and DFS and you were not supposed to make it specific to any puzzle. The search algorithm takes in each puzzle object had a win and a set of possible moves to make. So you do need to know how to play each game to finish the assignment. The difficult part of this assignment was to make a very efficient program that can solve the puzzles very fast. My first implementation took an hour to pass the test cases. So after each iteration, my program became faster and faster. Reflecting on this assignment, I really could have just googled BFS and DFS and think of conditions to prune entire sets of moves that were not needed to be considered. But that's part of learning, you go through the hardship of trying to optimize your code and derive the answers yourself.

### Reflection
I do have regrets not studying much in my first-year but not like I can change the past. However, I have bigger regrets about CSC108 and CSC148 than my performance. My biggest regret was perhaps helping certain individuals too much in the course. They have become too reliant on me and others to succeed in the course (some of them never even passed the course even after a few attempts). There needs to be a balance on how much you can help and know when to stop so that they can have the time to themselves to explore the concepts without being relying on you.

I have helped many students and most of them became quite successful and some who I am proud of even if they no longer are in the University due to their poor academic performance. I have met various students at different levels and I enjoyed teaching students who took the time to study and tell me various approaches on how they would tackle a particular problem. However, teaching unmotivated and unenthusiastic students is mentally draining and makes me wonder if I am suitable to teach and help students. I would often spend so many hours (over 40-60 hours throughout the semester trying to teach some students)  and guide them on concepts and problems without much success and never had the students be enthusiastic about the courses I helped them in. I fear that I may start to form anger issues from these experiences and decided I will probably stop teaching students in their courses.

Note: I was never a TA (always failed to be a CSC209 TA to my regrets) and I am not a paid tutor. I help students out of my free time and often lose hours of my studying time to help them out. 

# Second Year - 6 Courses
### CSC207: Software Design
**Professor:** Sadia Sharmin

**Coordinator:** Arnold Rosenbloom

**Description:** In this course, you will get introduced to agile development and best software development practices using Java. You will be taught version control for the first time using Git and learn various design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Manipulator Design patterns. In addition, you will also learn JUnit Testing, IEEE floating-point notation, and finite state machines. It's also the first time a student will be taught how to make a GUI program using Swing. Students will be required to work in groups of 4 for one of the assignments to have a feel of how agile development works along with the difficulty of working with a group. Students will also learn UML diagrams.

**TLDR:**
* Arnold is a great professor but his coordination is very questionable
* Working in a group is hard. Find a good group or else your experience in the course will be terrible
* A lot more time commitment required for the assignments
* DO NOT MERGE everyone's changes at the last minute. You should be merging changes throughout the entire duration of the project.

**Review:** CSC207 was an interesting course and very useful. Not only do you learn design patterns and agile development cycle, but you also learn how floats are formatted and some intricacies of what bad code is. To illustrate, a part of my first assignment was to find and create a list of primes through various methods and observe how fast or slow each method was. You learn how you access and insert elements to an array can affect the performance of the program along with the time complexity of the algorithm.

The group work is a major pain if you do not have a great group. I was fortunate to work with 2 students who were cooperative and so my experience was not at all bad. I did have difficulty contacting one member of the group who never responded to any of my emails till the day the project was due but I don't hold a grudge at all because the team was able to complete the project. Note: You do get to choose your own group. You can also pair up with students from other sections. I did not have any friends that were close enough to work with me.

Since the course is trying to teach students agile development, you will be required to frequently work and give updates on every sprint day, indicating your progress in the project. This allows you to be on top of things and avoid the assignment from not being completed. However, this also means that this course will often have you change your work schedule a lot.

The course is not hard but it does require a lot of time commitment. You need to be responsive to emails and texts from various team members and communicate any issues you have to the team. The tests were not at all difficult but not easy at all. Working with a team is also quite interesting because your changes can cause a conflict with another member's code so you learn how to deal with merge conflicts. In case you are wondering, the project we usually make in CSC207 is a Paint Program that can save and load files utilizing various design patterns.

<center>An example of a CSC207 Paint Project</center>

When working with a group, you need to ensure that each member merges their change after each user story and then perform a regression test on the program to ensure nothing gets broken. DO NOT MERGE ALL YOUR CHANGES ON THE LAST MINUTE. You will likely encounter merge conflicts and have a very very very difficult time fixing the merge conflict and find out which changes causes the program to break or behave differently. This is terrible software development practice. I've seen a group do this and all I can say is that they were not able to fix their merge conflict by the deadline and therefore did poorly in the course.

Sadia Sharmin is a young professor (or lecturer depending when you had her) who often seems like a student. She often gets confused as a fellow student or a TA. Although I never talked to her, she often hangs out with students (including many of my friends) and plays games with them. She is a great lecturer and is able to teach the course content in an easily digestible manner.

The course organization is questionable. A lot of students in the past few years have been very unsatisfied with the coordination of the course because Arnold Rosenbloom, a great professor (and is one of my favorite professors), is very disorganized. He is notorious for the chaos he causes due to his organization skills. Marks for this course will usually come out during the 2nd semester (which is many weeks late) and in some cases, you will never know the course average. However, he is trying his best and is always popping by the lab to see how students are doing and is very responsive. He tries to make students appreciate Computer Science and have them be very knowledgeable. I cannot name a professor who spends as much time as him to bring reforms and changes to the student's learning experience to produce great programmers and computer scientists. A lot of students dislike him because of this but I never met a student who said they did not learn anything from the course. Every student I asked from different years all agreed that despite the lack of organization skills he has and the heavy workload he gives us, we all learn a lot from his courses. I have no doubt that Arnold has increased the abilities of countless students in the field of Computer Science and is a great asset to the University.

### CSC236: Introduction to Theory of Computation
**Professor:** Larry Yulei Zhang

**Coordinator:** Larry Yulei Zhang

**Description:** In this course, you will be taught how to prove program correctness such as proving the correctness of iterative and recursive algorithms, divide and conquer, and master theorem. You will also be taught automata such as DFA and NFA and a bit about formal languages. More time complexity notations will be taught such as Big Omega and theta notations.

**TLDR:**
* Easiest Computer Science theory course you will take in University (easier than MAT102)
* Not too difficult but you need to make sure you keep yourself up to date and be familiar with induction and strong induction
* If you find yourself better at Math, you will find this course much easier than CSC207
* cheat sheets exist for the exam and tests

**Review:** This course is extremely important in Computer Science. This course is the successor to MAT102 (Introduction to Mathematical Proofs) and so you should remember how to do induction and strong induction before you take the course. CSC236 is probably the easiest theory course you will take at the university (it's also easier than MAT102 in case you were wondering). Anyone who wants to call themselves a computer scientist must know the content taught in this course as it is fundamental in Computer Science. Work is to be done on Latex (a way to write documents that makes writing math easy). The assignments can be quite challenging so I suggest you start early to give you time to think and perhaps work in pairs (for some odd reason I worked solo when you could work in pairs or in groups of 3). The course was interesting and Larry is a great lecturer. He makes the course content interesting and funny. People love his slides as well as it is filled with memes. Cheat sheets are allowed for the tests and exam and are very helpful if you have a poor memory like me.

### CSC209: Systems Programming and Software Tools
**Professor:** Ritu Chaturvedi (1st Attempt), Alan J Rosenthal (St. George), Furkan Alaca (my observation)

**Coordinator:** Andrew Petersen (1st Attempt), Alan J Rosenthal (St. George), Furkan Alaca (my observation)

**TLDR:**
* C is hard. You need a lot of practice.
* Know how to deal with memory properly or else it'll bite you
* Reverse style classroom
    * Complete your PCRS before lectures
    * Start on your lab early so you can go to the lab and ask your TA for help
* A lot of work. It's a time-consuming course
* If you like programming, you'll find CSC209 much easier than CSC263
* St. George CSC209 is usually a lot easier than UTM CSC209
* Segfaults are the nightmare of every C programmer


**Description:** In this course, you will be working with C to understand the basics of how Unix/Linux works such as how process and program execute, the memory model, system calls, interprocess communications (pipes and signals), and sockets. You will also learn various Unix tools and how to use the terminal. You probably will learn Bash (or Shell Bourne) as well.

**Review:** The course is very essential and is quite saddening to know you can graduate with a Computer Science major without taking this course (I have a lot of issues with the lack of requirements for a Computer Science major at UofT). The course is very interesting and is the first course you can take to learn about systems programming which I find very fascinating.

Unfortunately, like many others in my year, we did not have a great experience with the course and the organization was very poor that I am considering to rank this course organization to be worse than Arnold's organization. However, there were reasons for this disorganization so I shall omit most of my experience at UTM and talk about what I have observed over the years and based on my own experience as well at St. George.

The course is difficult for most students and the assignments are very time consuming and often trip a lot of students. C is a difficult language to get used to as you need to take into consideration a lot of things that we take for granted in high-level languages such as in Python. Dealing with memory properly is actually quite difficult and is often a source of program crashes, unexpected behaviors, and exploits. Hence why C is seen as a dangerous language to work with and why Rust is gaining popularity from my understanding. You'll come to love or hate C. It is almost impossible to never encounter a segfault and will often spend many hours tracking down where the bug is. Memory leaks are also a huge pain to track and close down.

<center>Excerpt from the official CSC209 2020 Meme Thread. Probably from xkcd comic</center>

Lectures are taught in reverse style where students are to learn the concepts from PCRS, an online programming exercise software, where students are to complete weekly challenges and watch the videos to understand the concepts before lectures. This has mixed results from my observation. Despite what studies show, I see reverse style classrooms only effective if the students take the time to learn which most students I've seen do not. Reverse style classrooms are very time consuming because you would often spend countless hours trying to understand what is wrong with your code or understanding a concept which could simply be taught in 5 mins in lecture. However, I have no doubts that those who put in the effort to participate in reverse classroom benefit more than traditional lectures. Going through all those struggles to solve problems yourself and learning the material beforehand allows students to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts. It also gives you enough time to ask any questions during class that they could not understand in their self-studies which makes better use of lecture time. 

You need to be on top of things and review materials before the lab and lecture. Weekly labs should be started before you enter the lab to maximize your time with the TA to ask questions. It also allows you to be ready for the lecture and not be lost because the professor assumes you already spent the time learning the material and will go in-depth on the concepts, work on problems with the class and answer any questions you may have.

<center>Excerpt from the official 2020 CSC209 Meme Thread</center>

The lectures are great and I heard very positive reviews about Andrew Petersen and Furkan Alaca. I had Ritu and Alan as my professor and both were great. Ritu met my expectation but I can see why a lot of students did not attend her lecture. To put it into perspective, there were only 14 students or less who attended the lecture I was assigned to meanwhile Petersen had a full class with over 100-200 students. Ritu is a very funny professor and I like my talks with her during her office hours. I felt that people just judged her unfairly. It was interesting to see someone open Wordpad and notepad to write programs during class. Alan was a great professor who teaches very effectively. I enjoyed his lectures a lot and was glad to learn shell bourne from him.

I did not find the assignments difficult but I definitely know a lot of students did and I often came to the labs to help out. However, I dropped the course at UTM because I did not like the way the course was structure, the automarker which I heard later on was very broken (there's a rumor that a student who dropped the course got over 50% on the assignment with just starter code), and the fact that we didn't get a lot of our marks till an hour before the drop date. This experience was very helpful to the professors because I never saw this mistake ever repeated. From my observations, the course is taught very well these days.

#### Differences between St. George and UTM
Despite people looking down on UTM when comparing to St. George, I found St. George courses to be much easier than UTM. The assignments are not only intuitive and not hard, the tests were easier than UTM. When I took CSC209 at UTM, Bash was optional (not anymore though) and so I was glad to drop CSC209 at UTM. Although it taints my transcript with an LWD which employers ask about, learning Shell Bourne and various things about Unix helped me a lot in my academic career and at my internship. Alan likes to focus on Bash or Shell Bourne a lot before learning C. I know quite a few students who took CSC209 at St. George just because it was easier. I can tell you that when I retook CSC209 at St. George, 1/3 - 2/3 of the class were from UTM (a lot of people dropped CSC209 in my year).

<center>Excerpt from the official 2020 CSC209 Meme Thread</center>

### Differences between Now and when I took CSC209 at UTM

When I took CSC209 at UTM, we barely learned gdb and never covered topics such as Valgrind and Bash. These days, I see labs cover gdb, Valgrind, bash, and use Address Sanitizer. There is much more emphasis on memory leaks. The assignments are quite interesting in 209 at UTM. I've talked to various CSC209 students over the years and helped students as well. Unfortunately, I never got a TA position which I would have loved to get. Some cool assignments I've seen in CSC209 are: manipulating sound files to give effects such as fade in and fade out, rsync imitation, a chat server that can send emojis, and implementing a primitive filesystem (this will help a lot for CSC369 - Operating System's assignment 3 which is implementing copy, delete, recover, rename, and creating files for EXT3). I like going on the CSC209 course website to see what they are learning and talking to students and TA for CSC209 (my friends) which made me be aware of the existence of Valgrind, address sanitizer and some neat details of various topics taught in the course.

### CSC258 - Computer Organization
**Professor:** Larry Yulei Zhang

**Coordinator:** Larry Yulei Zhang

**Description:** In this course, you will learn about logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits such as latches and flip flops. In addition, you will learn about a typical computer architecture such as the control unit and data path, instruction set architectures, and assembly programming on MIPS.

**TLDR (not much to say....):**
* Very fun course
* Easiest CS course in 2nd year

**Review:** Larry is an excellent professor and made the course quite enjoyable. The lab has two components, a prelab where you submit your circuit design and the lab where you program the FPGA using Altera. There's also a weekly quiz that tests you on the recent topics covered in class to ensure you keep up with the materials and a midterm and exam. The class was not difficult and probably is the easiest out of the 2nd semester CS courses in 2nd year (CSC209 and CSC263). Although we only briefly touched assembly, it was fun making recursion calls. The course I would imagine changed drastically so my knowledge of the course is very outdated. I loved the labs and made me understand more in-depth on how computers work. I have a confession to make, I never understood how flip flops worked even though it wasn't hard. It was only after 2 years from when I took the course that I understood how flipflop works. I read an excellent manga, [The Manga Guide to Microprocessors](https://www.amazon.ca/Manga-Guide-Microprocessors-Michio-Shibuya/dp/1593278179) and a book [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.amazon.ca/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319) that I understood all the concepts taught in the course. I was always ashamed of how I got a good mark despite not understanding how flip flops work so I decided to study CSC258 again with those books which I highly recommend.

### CSC263 - Data Structures and Analysis
**Professor:** Larry Yulei Zhang (UTM), Fatemeh Panahi (St. George)

**Coordinator:** Larry Yulei Zhang &amp; Daniel Zingaro (UTM), Fatemeh Panahi (St. George)

**Description:** In this course, students will be taught various data structures and their time and space complexities. Such data structures include hash tables, dynamic arrays, priority heaps, and AVL trees. Students will be introduced to average-case complexity and how to analyze data structures to come up with the average case and amortized costs.

**TLDR:**
* Very theoretical course
* useful for interviews
* If you are terrible at Math and theory, you'll struggle a lot in CSC263
* Beware of Daniel Zingaro (at least that's the meme)

**Review:** This course is extremely crucial for job interviews as it covers many topics that can be found in interviews. It is the most important and practical theory course you can take in your undergraduate. I found this course to be very difficult and challenging because I am not very great at theory. My partner for the assignment and I struggled a lot going through each problem set and ended up deciding to drop the course. We did very well on those problem sets (often with 90%+) but the number of hours we put into the course and our poor performance on the midterm made us reconsider taking the course. I contemplated dropping out of Computer Science entirely because I felt that if I could not pass CSC263, then how am I able to do upper-year theory courses. Luckily or unfortunately, I retook CSC263 in the summer at St. George and found it to be very easy compared to UTM. Even after I dropped CSC263 at UTM, I continued to attend Larry's and Zingaro's lectures (though I often find myself daydreaming after I dropped the course). 

Perhaps because this was my second attempt and the fact that UTM problem sets and tests were on a different scale (extremely hard) compared to St. George, I found CSC263 to be quite easy. I didn't put much effort in my second attempt and would often finish the problem set in a few hours, it made me wonder why students at downtown were struggling. I didn't do as well as I should have but considering the lack of studying I did in the course, it was decent enough.

**Note:** Daniel Zingaro is releasing a new book called Algorithmic Thinking: A Problem-Based Introduction on October 20 2020. As the name implies, it's a book tackling how to solve problems. However what makes different is that it removes all the heavy math notations and tries to explain problems in a more easier manner for the average student. I recall Zingaro once saying over a Residence Dinner event that he was very bad at algorithms and did poorly in University. But he is now teaching the subject and is an expert so I think this book would be quite appealing. I have not yet read the book (as it is not out yet) but I am excited to read it when it comes out. This book looks much more promising than his previous book Invariants (which I have not gone past the first chapter) as it aims to be more targeted to the average student who is looking for a book to help them tackle problems in a clear and concise way.

You can preorder the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Algorithmic-Thinking-Problem-Based-Daniel-Zingaro/dp/1718500807/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=algorithmic+thinking&amp;qid=1593637784&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1)
or at [No Scratch Press](https://nostarch.com/algorithmic-thinking)

Preordering at No Scratch Press gives you a much better deal with the coupon `PREORDER` for 25% off. Not only do you get a physical copy, you also get the early release digital copy as well. I have preordered from both sellers since I wanted to give one book as a gift to a friend.

### CSC290 - Communication Skills for Computer Scientists
**Professor:** Nia McCash

**Coordinator:** Nia McCash

**Description:** In this course, you will learn how to effectively communicate written and orally. You will learn about interpersonal communication and how to deescalate situations and avoid workplace communication issues. In addition, students will learn how to effectively write code comments and documentation. UML diagrams and case diagrams are taught in much greater depth than in 207. 

**Review:** This is a standard communication course for computer science students but I heard this course may be removed in the near future. Instead, students may have to take some writing course designed in collaboration with the writing department or just any set of writing courses the department approves of. Students will be writing weekly blogs or pieces of work (at least when I took it - this blog originally was for this course) and work in groups to present and write a project proposal (I cannot recall what that was about). The test was very interesting because there was two components to the test. The first component is just a normal test but in the second component, you discuss the answers about the test you just wrote not long ago with the group. You can see all my blogs from the course over [here](https://zakuarbor.wordpress.com/csc290/). It includes my view of the course whether or not it is useful and how I felt about the two stage test format.

### Reflection
For those doing a CS major or minor and wondering which courses are easier, it all depends on what you are good at. Are you better at programming or theory? If you find theory much easier, you will like CSC263 over CSC209. CSC258 is the easiest out of CSC209, CSC258, and CSC263 for the average student. However, CSC263 is quite an important course which allows you to take courses such as CSC343. It is also very useful to know for interviews and to program better. So you should plan ahead on what courses you want to take in 3rd year instead of choosing what is easier. I suggest you to take all three of them. You don't have to take all three in 2nd year but you should plan to eventually complete all of them as they open a lot of courses to you.

Similarly to first year, I really wished I studied much harder in my second year. I didn't necessarily slacked off but I sure didn't study hard enough. I ended up dropping CSC209 and CSC263 which changed my views about St. George as they were very easy over there. This will probably be the last year I regret not studying hard enough but not the last for dropping out of University (though my reason to consider dropping out of University changed because of financial reasons). Entering in my 3rd year with a weak foundation did hurt me a lot because third year was very tough for me.
