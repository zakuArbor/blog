title:  Going Back to School - Why Would Anyone Go Back?
categories: [school]
---

This is part 2 in the ongoing series where I am trying to 
rationalize/understand to myself and anyone interested in my decision 
to go back to school. Today's post goes over why I would even consider going 
back to school without going into specifics about why I choose to study Math 
and Physics.

The thought of going back to school dreads a lot of people. Why go back after 
spending 4 exhausting years studying and trying to find the money to pay 
for your education. However, there are many reasons why a person would 
go back to school.

It's usually either because they wish to upgrade their 
credentials such as obtaining an
undergraduate degree after completing college (in Canada, college focuses on 
the practical applications and hands-on education mainly focused on the 
trades (i.e. electrician, mechanic, cook) and typically only confers a 
diploma) or obtain a masters. Another typical reason is to change careers. 
While education is not mandatory in some career paths such as IT, 
an education related to the field can be very beneficial, easier, and 
at times mandatory.
                                
I'm in the group where I am open to change careers. 
There are three ways to look at University from what I know:                    
1. University is an investment                                                  
2. University is a place to widen your view and meet new people                 
3. University is a place to learn on a subject you are interested in            
                                                                                
While I won't expand on the details of each point I outlined, I can 
agree that my undergraduate studies in Computer Science has helped 
me obtain a nice starting salary at a tech firm, meet new people, and learn 
computer science in ways I never knew about and more in-depth than I have 
previously imagined it to be.                    

## Why Would I Consider Going Back?

There are many drawbacks of trying to go back to school such as the cost of 
the education, the time and commitment required and being delayed 
from progressing in different stages of life such as marriage or buying a house. 
There is no denying that education is expensive. While it is still relatively 
affordable in Canada (assuming you don't pay rent), a 4-year time commitment 
will make you behind your peers. You lose 4 years worth of 
industry experience and earnings which is very substantial. Those 4 years 
could have left me able to afford a decent downpayment for a house in Ottawa 
where I currently live. But more importantly, the loss of industry experience 
will hinder my ability to go up the corporate ladder.
                                                                                
However, after much reflections I decided going back to University is not a 
terrible idea for the following reasons:
* I have no other financial obligations (i.e. student debt, mortgage, and debt 
in general)                                                                        
* My parents are relatively fine both financially and in health                
* I have no social obligations (no children, no wife nor girlfriend)            

Much to my parents disapproval, I have no plans of: 
* getting married                                                               
* no plans of buying a house
* no desire to make a lot of money
                                                                                
Being young with no social, financial, nor legal obligations, I believe it is 
an ideal time to explore and figure what one wants to do with their life. 
Perhaps, the pursuit of finding what to do is pointless like the 
idea of pursuing happiness is found to be pointless. 
Only time will tell if I'll regret my decision.

## Summary

Considering my age, martial status, and financial status, it does not seem to 
be a terrible idea to explore and learn.
