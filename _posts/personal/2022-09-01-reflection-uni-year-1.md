title: A Reflection of My First Year Back in University
description: A reflection of my first year doing another undergrad
categories: [reflection, university, school]
---

As some may know, I have decided a while back to return to school to do another 
undergrad ([I wrote a series of blog posts on my rational](https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog/categories/#back-to-school)). 
To make the long story short, I got bored, felt incomplete in my knowledge and was always planning to return to school someday to study Physics. 
I went back to school to study Pure Mathematics and Physics starting from scratch but I am not comitted to finishing the degree (I already have 
a degree in Computer Science which is more marketable degree anyways). 

If I was to summarize my experience in three bullet points, it would be:
* I really dislike Science Labs and Science Courseload
* I surprisingly like Math a lot more than I anticipated (at least more than Physics)
* I am struggling a lot more than I have expected

I will avoid ranting about my long commute and how I dislike cooking but too cheap to 
buy food (I'll save that for next year's reflection when I have to 
wake up at 6am to commute to school and come home late).

This blog post will not cover in depth the courses I took as that is a separate topic 
and [I have written quite a few already anyways](../personal/#courses). The post will 
be split into two main sections: Science and Math. To give you a bit of context, this 
is a reflection of my first year which encompasses the Fall semester (2021), Winter (2022), 
and Summer (2022) semester. In the fall I took 2 math and 2 science courses while in the winter 
I took only one math course because I landed myself an internship (i.e. co-op) in the winter. 
Therefore I had to take summer courses to not fall too behind. But my summer courses are 
not exactly the courses I am supposed to take for my degree but are still accepted with 
some strings attached.

## Thoughts on Physics and Chemistry

Physics is a LOT HARDER than I imagined it to be. After finish first year, I still feel like 
I know nothing. I have taken Physics 1 before but my ability to solve problems have gotten 
worse compared to when I was studying Physics in Highschool or in my previous undergrad for fun. 
I would just be stumped on how to start each question and it would be great if I had friends in 
the course (I am an introvert who needs to be approached first and bugged for me to speak 
comfortably and openly with them).

[insert commentary after finishing PHYS1004]

Anyone who knows me knows that I hate labs which may sound stupid coming for a student 
studying physics. I gave up trying to study Engineering right after Highschool because of 
the horrors I heard about labs. I am so glad I studied Computer Science because labs are 
so annoying to work on. Unlike the horror stories I heard, I never had an issue performing 
the lab but writing those lab reports suck the soul out of me. I do learn a lot from writing 
the lab reports because I explore the topic much deeper (especially if I derive the equations 
myself). There's something special about deriving and writing the theory section of a lab. I 
had to constantly cross reference my textbook, notes online and the lab manual to ensure I 
am understanding each concept correctly and carefully. This is probably the only valuable part 
of the lab where I get something out of it. Occasionally, I learn something new when writing the 
discussion section where I explain how the experiment went based on the results and analyze what is 
going on but those moments are quite rare. Usually, the Discussion ends up being quite dull to write 
and pulling random ideas to justify why the results were not perfect. If you are able to 
derive the equations and understand the theory of the lab in depth, there's nothing much you learn 
from the rest of the lab.

Labs are so tedious to write and I would rather solve some math problems or look at some math theorems 
than writing lab reports. The only thing that keeps my ego when writing the lab reports is how beautiful 
my lab reports are. I have written lab reports in Highschool and in University before and those are 
garbage compared to the lab reports I write now. Firstly, my English comprehension and writing has 
vastly improved compared to when I was a Highschool student (English was my worst subject in Highschool 
and I was often asked if I was an international student due to my poor verbal and writing skills). 
Secondly, my skills using Latex to write my documents have gotten way better. I had very rudimentary 
knowledge of Latex when I was doing my undergrad in Computer Science. I have been playing around with 
various features and adding a lot of hypertext references linking equations, sections, citations, and footnotes. 
The ability to draw boxes around equations to highlight relationships between an equation with some polynomial function is something I often 
use to aid in my explanation of the theory. In addition, I started to use BibTex to format my citation 
instead of manually writing the citation for my sources. BibTex is a convenient way to cite sources 
for you and makes switching to different styles an extremely easy task to do.

My "photoshop" skills (i.e. Gimp - A free open source photo editor) have also increased from writing physics lab reports. 
I learned how to draw boxes (which is oddly way more difficult than it should be compared to MS Paint) and draw lines (again, MS Paint makes this 
clear for newbies unlike Gimp) to label the apparatus. While it doesn't look great, it does a good job conveying what each item in the lab is.

$$
\begin{align*}
F &= ma \\
&= 2 \cdot (-9.8) \\
&= \boxed{-19.6N}
\end{align*}
$$

I have been spoiled by the workload and diligence Computer science students take for granted. In computer science, workloads 
were very uneven and sporadic meaning you would have barely any work for a few weeks and then a week or two of late nighters. 
From my personal experience, once you get an assignment in computer science, every other professor will schedule an assignment around 
the same time or hold a test so it can be quite stressful. But in science, there are a lot of consistent mini assessments every week or two. 
For instance, you could be given an assignment every two weeks and a reading quiz every week for the lecture component. For the lab component, 
you could be given a pre-lab quiz, a lab, and a post-lab every two weeks and only given a week to write the lab report itself. So if you were 
taking multiple science courses, it really drains you very quickly if you are not used to this type of workload. I even decided to 
delay my graduation by an entire year by limiting myself to four courses a semester on most semesters because how time consuming 
science courses are.

As for my thoughts on chemistry, I really disliked it. I was lucky to have the labs be online which removes the 
fear of messing up an experiment. But chemistry was quite boring to me. I have no qualms with the professor as she 
taught the course very well but for some reason it didn't spark any desire inside me to learn. So I decided not to 
continue with Chemistry 2 till a much later date when I can find an appreciation for the subject. I am not taking 
the chemistry course that chemistry majors would take but a more lighter version for those who have no plans 
of taking any higher level chemistry course (from what I know, almost the same topics are covered as the 
regular chemistry course but there is a lower expectations on the students). Despite my dislike of the course, 
I did learn quite a few things that I found interesting such as the VESPR Model as it explains 
the shape of the molecules.

## Reflections on Math

As the course delivery for Math was online for the most part (there was in-person tutorials but all assessments were open book and 
submitted online), I heavily relied on cheat sheets (i.e. notes that summarize the entire course) to write my quizzes and exams. 
The problem with this is that courses are being back to in-person so I will not have access to my sheets that summarize 
the course with a few important examples. This means that I 
have not practiced nor likely studied nearly enough to be ready for 2nd year. My professor for the summer joked how they finally 
solved their 50% retention issue in the honors math (i.e. pure math) program because course averages during the fall and winter 
semesters went up. But the worry for the department will probably be seeing the impact of covid in student's performance now that 
courses are back to being in-person.

Although lectures were pre-recorded, I really loved my math courses a lot. Originally I was planning to go back to school studying 
physics only but I am very glad to choose to study pure math as well. Taking Calculus and Linear Algebra again in a different perspective 
(i.e. more theoretical and rigorous), I am finally starting to understand and absorb the material. One of the reasons why I really disliked 
math in the past was because I didn't understand why something was true and the rationality behind each step. I simply remembered the steps 
to solve a particular problem in the past which got me by my degree but it left me very clueless. By the time I was graduating with a degree 
in Computer Science, I realized I had absolutely no understanding of Calculus and Linear Alegbra. It is one of my biggest shame i
because I was close to getting a Math minor yet I had no clue what I was learning.

Due to my prior experience with mathematical proofs and university math in general, the transition to pure math 
was likely more smooth and way less painful than what my cohorts faced. Even those who have graduated with a degree 
will likely encounter difficulty because how different pure math is compared to the regular more application based 
math courses. But I definitely not at the level of math proffiency I would love to be and a lot of studying I 
need to do to catch up. I feel like my math fundamentals are weak which is concerning. I do not doubt that I 
meet the minimum expectations professors will have on me (provided they don't know I already have a degree) but 
I desire to do better than the minimum.

Due to conflicts with work in the winter, I was not able to take the honors (pure math) version of Linear Algebra 2, 
so I instead took the regular version instead. The course is more application based with little to no emphasis on 
proofs. But the professor does upload some proofs of the theorems presented in class for anyone who is curious 
and give more honors level types of questions at the end of every practice problems or in-class tutorial questions 
to get students to think a bit more deeper. Although the lectures are pre-recorded, the intent of the course was 
not to be online but rather in-person. Therefore, it was a good chance for me to transition to being back in-person 
where I write the tests and exam without any additional aid (i.e. my cheat sheets that I heavily relied on).

On the subject of writing quizzes, tests, and exams online, it was to my surprise that the level of difficulty for 
each of them were very fair considering we had access to the internet and our cheat sheets as it was an 
open-book exam. I am grateful for this as I clearly would not have done well in the course because of 
the lack of practice I have due to the existence of my cheat sheet.
