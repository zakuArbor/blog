title:  Going Back to School - Another Undergrad
categories: [books]
---

As the title states, I decided to resign from my job and go back to
University for another undergrad. This was not something I thought 
about overnight but for a very long time since I was a sophomore. 
Terminating my employment with the company I work with isn't due to any ill 
feelings to the team nor the company. I love working with my manager 
and with those in my team. 

Though I enjoyed my studies in Computer Science, I never wanted to study 
Computer Science nor work in the IT industry as a profession since Highschool. 
I wanted programming to be a hobby and never for professional work. 
But, I ended up studying Computer Science despite never applying to the 
program and it turned out great.

However, I always wanted to try something new, to branch out to other fields 
outside of computers.

## Goals of this POST
This is the first of a series of blog posts where I break down my thoughts and 
decisions for both myself and anyone interested. The goal is to 
understand and rationalize to myself whether the decision I made is foolish 
and figure what I want from this experience.

Here are my thoughts on how the series will be structure:
0. Announce my decision to return to school <-- Current Post
1. Why would someone go back to school
2. How did the Pandemic push Me to Make this Decision
3. Why did I choose to study Math and Physics
4. What are my Expectations and Goals from this

## An Overview of the Program I am enrolled In

I've been accepted to *Honours Major in Mathematics and Physics* at 
Carleton University located in Ottawa. This means I'll be spending the next 
4 years studying Physics and Mathematics, two subjects I am very uncomfortable 
with. I won't go into detail about why I would even consider going back to 
University nor explain why I would choose to study something I am not good at 
in today's post. That is a post for another time.

What I will go over today is an overview of what the program entails from my 
understanding. While I do not know much about University Physics at the 
undergraduate level, I am a bit familiar with the realm of Mathematics due to 
my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto Mississauga where I was 
only 2 courses short of graduating with a Minor in Mathematics. 

The program is a 4 year double honours program and requires students to 
complete 21.0 credits as opposed to the regular 20.0 credits an average 
honours program requires. Enrolling in a double honours program or a combined 
honours means 

> pursuing a double major does reduce the studentâ€™s overall number of elective courses

Similar to UofT, CarletonU follows the same credit weight where the 
completion of a typical 4 month course amounts to 0.5 Credit. A typical 4 year 
program requires students to complete 20.0 credits (i.e. 40 courses)i. Some 
programs do require more such as the program I am enrolled in or in Engineering 
where it's not rare for students to take 6 courses in some semesters to complete 
their degree on time without taking an extra semester (i.e. summer school).

While I could not find much information about the program, the 
[Mathematics Program and Admission webpage](https://carleton.ca/math/undergrad-programs-admission/#degree) 
describes the program as:

> an elite program that allows you to combine intense study of Mathematics with modern Physics. It will also prepare you for advanced study in theoretical Physics.
>
> -- [CarletonU Mathematics Program and Admission](https://carleton.ca/math/undergrad-programs-admission/#degree)

Keeping this description in mind and taking a look at the 
[program requirements](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/undergradprograms/physics/#Mathematics_and_Physics__BSc_Double_Honours) 
this seems to be accurate. Many students outside of Mathematics and 
Computer Science are unaware of the breadth and depth Mathematics can be. 
Talking with those outside of the realm of Mathematics, they seem to have a 
misunderstanding of what Mathematics is and I don't blame them. Highschool 
mathematics and general mathematics courses students take in first year 
such as Calculus for Engineers do not do a great job exposing students to the 
realm of Mathematics. There's a lot of great videos explaining what 
Mathematics entails such as [What I wish I knew Before Becoming A Math Major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk28BSaLszo), 
[The Map of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y), and many more 
such as videos from 3Blue1Brown and Zach Star.

Since the Mathematics courses I took in undergrad were only for Math majors, 
they are not eligible for transfer to the program I am enrolled in. This may 
come as a surprise to others because how different could Math for Mathematic 
Major differ from Math for Honours. The key difference between the two is the 
analysis and theoretical depth component that is lacking in the regular math 
courses for the Math courses taken by Engineers or by Math majors. 

A good illustration of the difference between a Math course for non honours 
students and a Math course for honours is to look at Calculus offered at UofT. 
There are many Calculus courses at UofT such as Math for Life Science, Math 
for Engineers, and Math for Business. Their focus is very different from each 
other. But within the Math department, there are different levels of first year 
calculus depending on the level of Mathematics the student wishes to pursue. 
For students in the Math Specialist (i.e. honours Math equivalent at CarletonU), 
students must enroll in Calculus with Proofs (MAT137). This math course is 
notorious for its difficulty. It's so difficult for the average student 
that the department allows any students who perform poorly in the course to 
transfer to the less rigorous Math course (i.e. Calculus for Math majors) 
in the middle of the semester. This is unheard of in any course I've 
seen because usually if you do poorly, you'll have to drop the course and wait 
for a semester or even an entire year to enroll in another calculus course. 
This isn't even the hardest and in-depth first year
calculus course the university offers from what I heard.

Due to this difference in approach and depth, I am required to take all my 
Math courses again. While I have no qualms about it, I do have an issue with 
the fact I need to retake an Introductory Course to Mathematical Logics 
because I've taken this course twice at my previous University. I would have 
understood this decision if the course was more rigorous than those taken by 
the Math major but it is not. All my Math courses at UofT were under the Math 
department that shared the same requirements as any Math major. Anyhow, I'll 
have to consult with the University sometime soon if I want to make room 
for electives because the program offers almost no electives.

On the bright side, I was able to transfer 2.5 Credits (5 Courses):
* 1 Course in Computer Programming
* 2 Courses Outside of Science and Engineering
* 2 Free Electives

This gives me the flexibility to fit 5 courses of my interest during the
duration at the University. I have some courses in mind such as a course in 
Compilers, Distributed Computing and Graphics Programming. These were the 
courses I was very interested in taking but did not due to various reasons 
during my previous undergrad.

There are also some courses that overlap between the Mathematics and Computer 
Science departments I wish to enroll in but I'll have to see if I can fit 
those in my schedule. There are times where I have considered switching my 
program to a Math major just to gain that flexibility in the Math courses I 
can take but I'll wait and see how I perform in first year before making 
any decisions.

## Summary

I am resigning from my job and returning to school for another undergraduate 
in Honours Major in Mathematics and Physics where I'll be studying intensive 
Math and Physics for the next 4 years. While I do not know what I'll do 
with my studies, I'll be trying to explore and rationalize my decision in 
the next few posts and over the years. Only time can tell.

Some additional details are that I'll be retaking all my Math courses since 
the Math courses I've taken are only for Math majors which are not rigorous 
enough for the Honours Program. Luckily I was able to transfer a few 
courses to cover the breadth requirements and the introductory computer 
programming course so I can make room to take senior-level Computer 
Science courses for fun.
