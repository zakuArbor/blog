title:  Going Back to School - Expectations and Hopes
categories: [school, back-to-school]
---

Perhaps I didn't give it much thought till now. But what are my expectations and 
goals I want to go back to school and from this degree? 
That's what I will be exploring today and on a quarterly basis 
as I progress through my studies. Especially since the cost of going for 
another degree and resigning from my job has a lot of costs financially and 
time.

## How Long Will I Be Studying?

---

**tldr:**
* 4 years to finish the degree
* all my credits transferred covers the breadth and elective requirements and 
a course in discrete mathematics
* May not finish the degree but I plan to finish half at the minimum
* Will decide based on my assessment after studying for 2 years

For those of you who have not been following 
my previous 3 posts in this series, I am going to start my first year in 
Mathematics and Physics starting this fall. I have a degree in Computer Science,
and if you know anything about Computer Science, 
there are not many courses that overlap with Physics aside from Calculus 
and perhaps an introductory course to programming.

In a [previous post](../going-back-to-school-1), I discussed what credits I 
was able to transfer. To give a brief overview, I will have to retake all my 
Math courses aside from Discrete Mathematics because my courses 
did not focus on analysis (think of it as not being theoretical enough). 
Therefore, my transfer credits only cover any courses I need to take outside 
of Math and Physics which is not much. Therefore, I'll need 4 years minimum 
to complete the degree.

To be completely honest, I am not even sure I would even complete the degree. 
My only motivation to go back to school was to cover my curiosity and take a 
few more computer science courses. I think 2 years of Math and Physics will be 
sufficient to have enough base knowledge to explore myself with the guidance 
of the internet. I will evaluate after sophomore (2nd year) whether I should 
finish the degree or not.

A friend from University was in a similar situation where he quit his job to 
learn programming out of curiosity (he did not show too much interest 
in working in tech). 
Seeing how he went back to the workforce halfway to the program 
makes me doubt myself. Without a clear goal in mind of what you want out of your 
2nd degree and the option to return to the workforce makes me wonder how can I 
keep myself from following that path. There's absolutely nothing wrong with 
quitting if you decide the field is not for you. However, I worry that it'll 
be a hindrance to myself from making the most out of this journey.

What I desire is to make the most out of my studies for 2 years and then 
determine whether or not it is worth my time and money to continue.

## Criteria to Continue Studying

---

There are a few factors I will consider whether or not I'll continue my studies:
* **Do I enjoy my courses:** Ultimately, if I am in misery then there's no 
point in continuing my studies. There weren't many benefits from obtaining 
another degree to begin with. If I am in misery, it's better to quit and 
work. Even if I detest my job, at least I'm making money while in misery 
which is way better than being in a situation where I lose money and still be 
in misery.

* **Am I Learning:** The entire point of going back to school is to learn. If 
I am not making any progress in my studies, then all my time, money, and 
effort were pointless. Therefore, I aim to learn as much as I can by doing 
well in my courses and taking every opportunity to learn the subject more 
whether that be talking with my classmates, professors or searching for 
materials on the internet to supplement my education. I aim to learn for 
the sake of learning and not cramming information the night before to pass.

* **Academic Performance:** Although difficult, I am aiming for an A- or 
higher CGPA (>= 10.0/12.0) during my studies. There are a few reasons for this 
which I'll get into a bit later. Simply doing fine is not acceptable due to 
the loss I'll be incurring from going back to school. In addition, you 
should always strive higher than what you have already achieved. In my Alma 
mater, I have achieved a B+ (3.35/4), so the next letter grade is an A-. So 
if I stray far from that goal or finding myself stagnant due to my 
incompetence then I do not think it's worth continuing my education. I am not 
saying I must achieve a good grade to make my education worth it. If I truly 
enjoy the subject and spending great efforts to reach my goal then I would be 
satisfied even if I fail to reach my goal of obtaining a CGPA of an A- or 
higher.

* **Opportunities:** If I find a better opportunity or interest, then I may 
ditch my education to pursue it. This could be working at a firm that is 
working on a project that catches my interest. As I stated earlier, I am not 
fully committed to completing my degree. If I feel satisfied or I find a great 
opportunity, I'll leave school and go back to work.

## What I Hope to Achieve

---

It should come as no surprise that I want to have a solid 
foundation in Physics and Math (why else would I go for more schooling). It 
is a common trap for students to think they have a solid foundation in the 
thing they are studying. Having decent or good grades does not mean you have 
a solid grasp of the concepts. I also do not want to take my learning passively, 
whereby I attend class and study for the sake of obtaining the credit. If I am 
going back to school, I need to be learning and absorbing the information in a 
manner that makes me appreciate the subject. As stated earlier, I am aiming 
to have an A- CGPA and SGPA which will be a struggle in itself. Mathematics and 
Physics become extremely hard in upper years so I am a bit worried if I can 
achieve this goal. Having a good AGPA and CGPA allows me to have a good chance 
in graduate school and obtain scholarships to help pay my tuition. The University 
rewards those on the dean's list with \$750 (if I obtain an A-) or <span>$1000</span> (if 
I get over an A-). While it's not much, it'll help me buy books 
and any equipment I would need to aid in my studies.

Although I have not mentioned in my previous posts, when applying to go back 
to school, I originally did not apply to study Mathematics and Physics. I 
applied to Computer Engineering and Engineering Physics 
because I was scared of studying purely in 
Mathematics and Physics. In addition, I wanted to learn more about hardware 
because I came to be interested in the subject in my final year of university 
where I took a course in Parallel Computing. Being outside of Engineering makes 
it very difficult to enroll in circuit design & analysis and in microcontroller 
courses. However, I decided a few days before the New Year's (months after 
I applied to Universities) that I should study Mathematics and Physics. This was purely 
because computer engineering will not help me understand natural 
phenomena as much compared to studying Physics. Secondly, I want to challenge 
myself and go outside of my comfort zone. Going into Engineering felt like 
taking the easy route and would limit my resolve (not saying Engineering is 
easy but it's less of a challenge imo compared to studying purely in Mathematics 
and Physics).

Furthermore, I want to avoid repeating a mistake I have made in my Alma mater 
which is not talking with my professors much. Although I have no plans to 
talk with my professors much during freshman, I definitely will take advantage 
of office hours for help and advice in the field. One of the factors as to 
why I did not consider graduate school is my lack of contact with my professors. 
I do not want to repeat this mistake, especially since if I do want to 
pursue a career in Mathematics or Physics, I would need to go to graduate school.

## Research and Internship

---

Co-op is a great way to earn money and gain experience during your studies. 
While I do have work experience having done a 4 month Highschool co-op, 
16-month internship and about a year of full-time experience in the tech industry, 
it's very narrowed to working on the infrastructure side of software development. 
I never worked on software projects (I do write scripts, programs, and debug 
code at work but that's not my main role). Therefore, it would be nice to 
have more development experience. In addition, getting a job as a student 
is far easier. I want to get a foot in the hardware and communication 
industry of tech such as working on the software side of CPUs/GPUs or in 
networks whether that be Wireless Communications, 5G, or Bluetooth. For fun, 
I also want to challenge myself to companies that are notorious for their 
difficulty such as Google. Other fields I considered were in the aerospace 
industry where knowledge of Physics and Math would be required.

However, doing co-op will delay my graduation by another year which is not 
something I am interested in doing. So I may just try a term or two of co-op 
and stop (co-op is 4 months long and there are 4 co-op terms students need 
to complete the co-op program).  
While I do want to gain some experience 
during my studies, I also want to take the opportunity to do research. Math 
and Physics graduate schools are keen to have students with research experience, 
so I would prioritize any opportunities to do research.

## Abroad Studies and Clubs

---

Friends are important and are a great resource to seek help in your studies. 
I greatly benefited from interacting with my classmates and with anyone who 
hangs out in the labs. So I will not deny that I will need to make friends 
during university. However, I don't think the typical student in my program 
will be enrolled in the clubs I would be interested in. 
I haven't looked at the clubs at the University and the current pandemic has 
effectively stopped clubs from functioning (or at least limited club 
activity significantly), the clubs I am thinking of are: a bible study club, Taichi if it exists, Cybersecurity

I do know there are some science and engineering clubs I could attend to but 
most of the students there won't be my classmates such as the club that 
works on making space rovers (i.e. essentially an engineering club). I think 
the most effective way to make friends in your program is to meet them through 
classes (which may not work during the pandemic ...).

Abroad studies have been in my mind ever since the Italian department has invited 
me to study at Florence University after I spent 2 semesters studying the 
language when I was a freshman. I've been interested in studying/working in 
another country to experience how different it is.

In recent weeks, I've been thinking that 
it would be better to study in France if I were to do an abroad study 
so that I can practice and learn French. 
Exposing yourself to a country that speaks the language is the best way to 
learn the language. I have a long-term goal of becoming bilingual by the time 
I am 30 years old so abroad studies would definitely be a stepping stone 
towards that goal. If I were to do abroad studies, I would probably only 
do it for a semester and only during my 3rd year.

## Summary

---

While I do not expect myself to spend 4 years to finish the degree, I aim to 
solidify my foundation in Mathematics and Physics and learn for the sake of 
learning. It is in my belief that I will be able to evaluate after 2 years 
whether I should continue my studies after I have a clearer idea 
of the subject, opportunities, my academic performance, and personal evaluation 
of my education. I have outlined what my goals are in a broad sense such as 
what grades I want to achieve after each academic year but my goals will be 
more refined as each quarter passes. I hope the goals and expectations I have 
laid out are realistic and achievable.
