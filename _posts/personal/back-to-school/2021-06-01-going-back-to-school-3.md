title:  Going Back to School - Why I Choose to Study Math and Physics
categories: [school, back-to-school]
---

Todayâ€™s post is part 3 of the ongoing series of my decision to go back to school. 
Though this post is supposed to rationalize and understand why I decided to quit my job to study math and physics, I do not think there is a good reason for this.
The idea of going back to school was never a new idea to me as I have been very open to the idea of going back to school ever since I started University. 
Originally the agreement with my parents when deciding what to do after Highschool was that I graduate from University and they would permit me to go to trade school afterward. 
Although I had some interest in becoming an electrician, it was just something I decided with no particular reason and decided to stick with it throughout Highschool.

## Background

---

You can read [my blog on what made me study Computer Science](../my-personal-journey-in-choosing-what-to-do-after-high-school) 
for the background why I decided to study Computer Science. But to summarize, 
I did not particularly want to study Computer Science. I liked learning 
various programming languages and work on mini side projects, but I did not 
want to make a career out of it. Therefore, I never applied to 
Computer Science. I just got an alternative offer to study Computer Science 
and I decided to accept it.

In my final year of Highschool, I did not have any ambitions and therefore 
I did not know what I wanted to do in life. But I was interested in studying 
Physics due to the positive experience I had in Highschool. Although it 
was not my strongest subject, I had tons of fun in the course. Furthermore, 
my interest in Mobile Suits (from the anime Gundam) and my weird obsession 
with Nuclear Energy at the time, I considered studying Physics. But the 
market for a Physics major was scarce so I never applied. I also do not 
consider myself scientifically literate. If anyone asks me a simple science 
question that any Highschool student should know after taking a course in 
Physics, Chemistry, or Biology, I would have a hard time being able to answer 
them if I was not taking the course currently. This shows my lack of 
understanding of the subject and the flaw in the way I study.

As for why I did not study Math, I simply did not like 
Math at all and consider myself to be terrible at Math. It may come as a 
surprise, but I was a former student in the special needs 
class due to my poor performance in Math.

Therefore it may come as a mystery why I would even quit my job to study 
Math and Physics.

## Why Math

---

Despite not being knowledgeable in Math and Physics, it is a bit weird for 
me to quit my job to pursue an undergrad in those subjects. Similar to 
Computer Science where I had some background in the subject beforehand 
(through self-studying), I now feel that I have enough exposure to the subject 
to be able to succeed and appreciate the subject. Through my undergrad studies 
in Computer Science have exposed me to a realm of Mathematics that I did not 
realize. I never realized there was more to Math than just computation (i.e. 
plugging numbers into equations) and this excited me. Although I almost failed 
the course that opened my eyes (i.e. Introduction to Mathematical Proofs 
where I was 1% away from the exam from failing the course and ended up getting 
a D), it was a start for me to appreciate Math for what it is. Furthermore, 
math becomes useful in senior years when you start taking specialized courses 
where an understanding of Mathematics becomes useful such as in Image 
Processing, Machine learning, and Robotics. It's the moment where all your 
Math courses during your freshman years become of some use.

During my undergrad in Computer Science, I started to appreciate Math more and 
more after each time I completed a Computer Science theory course. The two 
courses that made me appreciate Math the most aside from the introductory 
course to Mathematical Proofs were <i>Computational Complexity and Computability</i> 
and <i>Complex Variables</i> (I was removed from the course sadly for lacking 
prerequisites since the main campus and the campus I studied at had different 
requirements). I just loved being in those classes and was excited to 
attend the next lecture.

I was always going to go back to University to study Physics but my experience 
with "Math" at University made me decide to also go back to study Math. I want 
to study Math properly because I neglected it a lot in Highschool and during 
my first two years of University so my foundations were not as strong as I 
would like them to be. Math was my weakest subject in University bringing 
down my CGPA quite a lot. Hopefully, that will not be the case this time 
(or else I'm in serious trouble).

## Why Physics

---

It was always my intention early in my studies in Computer Science that I 
would go back to University to study Physics. Though I was contemplating if 
I should simply just add a Geography major in my undergrad instead, saving me 
from going back to University afterward. The major constraint from graduating 
with another major was my interest in taking a lot of computer science 
courses and poor course scheduling. In addition, I simply did not have money 
to do an extra year. I was planning to quit University during my third 
year and just join the military to fund my education if I did not get an 
internship because I did not want to ask for money from my parents.

I always felt incomplete because I wanted to understand the world more and 
Computer Science does not provide that. I could learn about the world through 
books and documentaries but I wanted the ability to work in fields that 
require an in-depth knowledge of science. I often felt having only a 
Computer Science degree was pointless without coupling it with something 
else whether that be another major or an interest in something like 
healthcare. Unless you are going into Computer Systems or theory, it makes 
sense to have an interest in something that can complement your knowledge 
in Computer Science. I do not want to work on something where I cannot 
have a connection with the product. I once worked on reimplementing a 
Chemical Patent Software and felt very disconnected from the product itself 
due to my lack of knowledge in the subject. While I was only a frontend 
developer so I did not need to understand Chemistry, it bothered me a lot. I 
want to understand the product I am working on to the point where I would see 
myself using the product. I am not motivated by money. I am motivated to work 
on something I think is interesting (does not have to be important). My 
company pays and treats me well to the point I feel guilty about leaving. 
My interest in branching outside of computers made me leave my job.

Anyhow, the reason why I choose to study Physics is simply because of my 
positive experience of Physics in Highschool. If not Physics, I probably 
would have just studied Physical Geography. I want to explore if scientific 
computing would be something I would be interested in or perhaps go into 
academia. I have been interested in science solely because it explores 
and tries to explain the phenomenon around us such as how the Universe was 
formed, how to harness and utilize nuclear energy, or how things work on 
Earth. The idea of not knowing much about the planet and Universe you live in 
sounds a bit weird to me. I do understand there are just way too many things 
I will never understand. But I at least want to have a solid understanding of 
at least one physical reality such as the processes of Earth's surface and 
atmosphere.

## Academia or Industry

---

I do realize Math and Physics do not have many career options without 
pursuing higher-level education. I am open to the idea of pursuing 
higher-level of education and also going to academia. 
I am still debating whether I 
want to work in academia or the industry. 
In my junior year (3rd year of University), 
I was exposed to a wide range of Computer Science courses. 
The amount of breadth and depth these courses offered made me take my 
studies seriously and spark joy in learning. 
I did not consider graduate studies because I did not want to specialize in 
anything. Though there are several other reasons why I did not consider 
graduate studies, one of which is my lack of research and 
relationships with the professors.

I want to tackle the idea of going to academia because I want to work on 
something I find interesting and not because the market demands it. 
I do realize it is hard to get funding if you cannot promote the impact your 
research has on the market or on society as a whole. 
However, academia offers more flexibility and freedom to pursue things 
you are interested in without trying to tie every decision to a 
monetary value. The orientation for new full-time employees made me very 
unexcited due to the emphasis on making decisions that give monetary benefit 
to the company.

## Summary

---

As from what you can see, there's no real good reason as to why I would 
go back to University to study Maths and Physics. It's something I am curious 
about and it's just to complete the void I felt from just studying Computer 
Science. 

However, studying Maths and Physics can potentially open to careers 
where a mix of math, science, and computer science would be required. The 
next blog will lay what my expectations are from this degree. Spoiler alert, 
I do not expect myself to graduate with an undergrad in Math & Physics. I am 
going back to school with what I view as realistic expectations.
