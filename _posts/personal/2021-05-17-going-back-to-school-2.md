title:  Going Back to School - Why Would Anyone Go Back?
categories: [school]
---

The thought of going back to school dreads a lot of people. Why go back after 
spending 4 exhasuting years studying and trying to find the money to pay 
for your education. However, there are many reasons why a person would 
go back to school.


It's usually either because they wish to upgrade their 
credentials such as obtaining an
undergraduate degree after completing college (in Canada, college focuses on 
the practical applications and hands-on education mainly focused on the 
trades (i.e. electrician, mechanic, cook) and typically only confers a 
diploma) or obtaining a masters. Another typical reason is to change careers. 
Typically those I see who come back to University is because they wish to 
work in the tech field. While a degree in Computer Science or Engineering is 
not required, those who have absolutely no clue where to start or feel that 
it's worth going to University to study computers will opt to this route.     
                                
  
I'm in the group where I am considering to change careers though not in tech. 
There are three ways to look at University from what I know:                    
1. University is an investment                                                  
2. University is a place to widen your view and meet new people                 
3. University is a place to learn on a subject you are interested in            
                                                                                
While I won't expand on the details of each point I outlined, I can definitely 
agree that my undergraduate studies in Computer Science definitely has helped 
me obtain a nice starting salary at a tech firm, meet new people, and learn 
computer science in ways I never knew about and much more in-depth than what I 
have self studied in High School.

## Goals of this POST
This is the first of a series of blog posts where I break down my thoughts and 
decisions for both myself and anyone interested. The goal is to 
understand and rationalize to myself whether the decision I made is foolish 
and figure what I want from this experience.

Here are my thoughts on how the series will be structure:
0. [Announce my decision to return to school](../going-back-to-school-1)
1. Why would someone go back to school <-- **Current**
2. How did the Pandemic push Me to Make this Decision
3. Why did I choose to study Math and Physics
4. What are my Expectations and Goals from this

## Why Would I Consider Going Back?

There are many drawbacks of trying to go back to school such as the cost of 
the education, the time and commitment required, and being delayed 
from progresing in different stages of life such as marriage or buying a house. 
There is no denial that education is expensive. While it is still relatively 
affordable in Canada (assuming you don't pay rent), a 4 year time commitment 
will definitely make you behind from your peers. You lose 4 years worth of 
industry experience and earnings which is very substantial. Those 4 years 
could have left me able to afford a decent downpayment for a house in Ottawa 
where I currently live. But more importantly, the loss of industry experience 
will hinder my ability to go up the corporate ladder.
                                                                                
However, after much reflections I decided going back to University is not a 
terrible idea for the following reasons:                                        
* I have no other financial obligations (i.e. student debt, mortgage, debt in 
general)                                                                        
* My parents are relatively fine in both financial and in health                
* I have no social obligations (no children, no wife nor girlfriend)            
* I have no social obligations (no children, no wife nor girlfriend)            
                                                                                
Much to my parents dissapproval, I have no plans of: 
* getting married                                                               
* no plans of buying a house - house prices are just so ridiculous and it       
seems to increase rapdily                                                       
* no plans of making a lot of money                                             
                                                                                
Being young with no social, financial, nor legal obligations, I believe it is 
ideal time to explore and figure

I do not see much harm exploring while I am young, especially when I am 
stable financially. I do not have any ambitious goals in life that would 
require me to have a substantial amounts of money. Therefore, I am not 
concerned with my financial status. I already have a degree and some 
work experience that is valuable by the job market. So if I am ever in need 
for cash, I can always go back to the IT Industry.

A manager told me recently that it's best to explore and try things when you 
are young before you have too many obligations to fullfill. Once you have 
children, you need to compromise a lot to ensure you are able to provide the 
emotional, financial, and civil responsibilities as a parent. Therefore, a 
parent would have much more difficulty leaving their job because they need to 
consider their dependents and any loans they owe such as a house mortgage.

## Summary

I am resigning from my job and returning to school for another undergraduate 
in Honours Major in Mathematics and Physics where I'll be studying intensive 
Math and Physics for the next 4 years. While I do not know what I'll do 
with my studies, I'll be trying to explore and rationalize my decision in 
the next few posts and over the years. Only time can tell.

Some additional details are that I'll be retaking all my Math courses since 
the Math courses I've taken are only for Math majors which are not rigorous 
enough for the Honours Program. Luckily I was able to transfer a few 
courses to cover the breadth requirements and the introductory computer 
programming course so I can make room to take senior-level Computer 
Science courses for fun.
